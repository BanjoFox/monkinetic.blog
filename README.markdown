## Monkinetic Weblog

This is my weblog. I've been writing here in one form or another since 1997, though my archives only go back to 1999.

The current form is a Jekyll-built Gitlab pages site because I'm in a attention-reduced state these days and I cannot be bothered to maintain my own server just for this blog.
