## Monkinetic Weblog

This is my weblog. I've been writing here in one form or another for over 16 years, though my archives only go back to 1999.

The current form is a Jekyll-built Github pages site because I'm in a attention-reduced state these days and I cannot be bothered to maintain my own server just for this blog.
