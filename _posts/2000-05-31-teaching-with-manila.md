<a href="http://www.cs.strath.ac.uk/~duncan/frontier/manilaclipper.html#quoter">Manila Clipper</a> is really cool. So is Manila Quoter. Both can be found <a href="http://www.cs.strath.ac.uk/~duncan/frontier/manilaclipper.html#quoter">here</a>.

Web geek and proud of it: I just ordered a <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/brain/bazaar/mart/cart.cgi?action=view&amp;type=item&amp;itemid=31b3">www sticker</a> today. anyone having spent time in Europe will know where <i>I&#39;m</i> from!

I totally want <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/brain/bazaar/mart/cart.cgi?action=view&amp;type=item&amp;itemid=31cf">one of these</a>.

Over in Wes&#39;s (Hack The Planet&#39;s) <a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/discuss/">discuss group</a>, David McCusker and several other people I&#39;m growing to highly respect are making that DG a daily lurk for me. I am in awe of these minds.
