I wonder if Nate got any hits yesterday from &quot;Redmonk.Net&quot;. I don&#39;t know if anyone reads this site anymore, since it&#39;s hardly ever updated (but I&#39;m trying!)

Having just compared a good, anti-aliased Helvetica to a comfortable white wine, I am asked by Hans if I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not a marketer. I&#39;ve never met a marketing person with a decent appreciation for fine typography. &lt;harumph&gt;

Woohoo! Omni Group releases [OmniOutliner][1], an outliner for [Mac OS X][2]! Now, if they&#39;d only post screenshots...  Update: [Jim][3] has pics of the new OmniOutliner. It&#39;s kinda nice... I&#39;d like to see a simpler version one could use for coding in. Mmmmm, code outlines.
