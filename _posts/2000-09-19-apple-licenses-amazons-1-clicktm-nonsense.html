<a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2000/sep/18amazon.html">Apple Licenses Amazon&#39;s 1-Click(<font size="+1">TM</font>) Nonsense</a>

This is surreal. I keep looking for the bogus URL or date to tell me this is an April Fool&#39;s joke or something. Can they take this seriously?

This is foolishness... what was Apple thinking? More accurately, what was Steve Jobs thinking? <i>Was</i> Steve Jobs thinking?
