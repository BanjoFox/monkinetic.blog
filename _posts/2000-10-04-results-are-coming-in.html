I&#39;ve now had a chance to use &quot;Mac OS X&quot; on both a 12&quot; 800x600 iBook, and a 19&quot; 1200x1600 monitor. I was pleased to discover that Mac OS X&#39;s Aqua interface works well on both. 

It&#39;s true that the iBook screen leaves little extra room, but the fact that the dock can be sized down really helps.
