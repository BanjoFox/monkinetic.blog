This sounds <b>really</b> cool: <a href="http://www0.mercurycenter.com/svtech/news/breaking/ap/docs/731001l.htm">MindRover</a> is a game in which you design robots, wiring them up in what amounts to a visual boolean logic programming environment, then they compete in 3D arenas against the computer.
