<a href="http://scobleizer.manilasites.com/">This</a> seems to be a good blog. Lots of impressions on Whistler, Microsoft&#39;s new version of Win2k. Robert says it&#39;s boing to be a blog war this year over &quot;Mac OS X&quot; and Whistler.

Anyone out there want to suggest a good default link for &quot;Whistler&quot;?
