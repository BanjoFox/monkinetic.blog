I thought the title for this movie was &quot;Castaway&quot; - noun form... I was glad to see that the correct title is the two-word past-tense verb form, it gives a much dfferent feel. (Am I a freak for noticing the grammatical forms of movie titles?)

Jodi and I saw this last night - a powerful movie, although the ending was a bit weak. I&#39;m not one who wishes it would&#39;ve had a Hollywood ending, but I though the execution on the wrap-up could have been tighter.
