I just noticed while browsing <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com">O&#39;Reilly</a>&#39;s <a href="http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/conference/index.html">P2P site</a> that all their ad links are redirected through  <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/">DoubleClick</a>&#39;s servers. I have my browser set to refuse most cookies, especially DoubleClick&#39;s. 

Doubleclick has had run-ins with privacy advocates in the past, especially since they started using &quot;web-bugs&quot; - single-pixel gifs served from Doubleclick&#39;s ad servers design to facilitate user tracking through sites.

Frankly, with O&#39;Reilly&#39;s involvement with the open-source community, I&#39;m suprised that they&#39;re using DoubleClick. 

The open-source and privacy-advocacy communities have a lot of overlap, and I could be wrong, but this seems that it could come back to bite O&#39;Reilly.
