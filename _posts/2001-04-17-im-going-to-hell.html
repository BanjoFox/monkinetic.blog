Today I&#39;m looking to do something I never thought I would do, and am fairly certain that I&#39;m risking hell-fire: I&#39;m looking to install Microsft Visual Basic on my pc. The situation at work has gotten to the point where we are likely to be billed out as M$ platform web developers, so my only chance at survival is to see if there&#39;s a way to implement some time-tested ideas in a new (shudder) environment.

If anyone out there knows of an ASP or COM (preferably COM) based template system, please <a href="mailto:steve.ivy@compass.net">let me know</a>.

BTW - by templating I mean a <a href="http://www.webmacro.org">WebMacro</a>-style macro-processing engine.
