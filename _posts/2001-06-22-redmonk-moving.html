Redmonk.Net is switching servers this afternoon. Jim did some benchmarks for me on current site speed (numbers in ticks):<p>

http://www.redmonk.net/ number: 2076<br />
http://www.redmonk.net/fastlog number: 1302<br />
http://www.redmonk.net/software/Sid number: 629<p>

I&#39;m looking forward to see the new numbers after the move! (at 2:30 EST)</p></p>
