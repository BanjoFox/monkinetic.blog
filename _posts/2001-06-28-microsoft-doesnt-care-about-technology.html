John Rhodes <a href="http://webword.com/moving/misdirection.html">makes the case</a> that as long as we&#39;re concerned about Microsoft&#39;s <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2001/06/27/dotnet.html">shared source</a>, or <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/decentralization/message/2978">smart tags</a>, Microsoft is winning, because they are moving to a service model where they control the infrastructure of <a href="http://www.passport.com/Consumer/default.asp?lc=1033">authentication and personal information</a>, and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/hailstorm.asp">internet services</a>. <i>Hmmm</i>.
