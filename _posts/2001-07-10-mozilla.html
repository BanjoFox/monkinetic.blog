Jim has started using <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> as his main browser. I&#39;ve downloaded it and am checking it out. Jim
s right - it&#39;s fast as... it&#39;s fast. But there are some nagging bits that are bugging me: The current gotcha is that I can&#39;t seem to drag bookmarks around in my &quot;Manage Bookmarks&quot; window. I want to! I really do! But Moz seems to not like drag and drop. How do I re-organizae my bookmarks then? Jim?
