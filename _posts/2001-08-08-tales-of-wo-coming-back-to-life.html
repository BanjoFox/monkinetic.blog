Jim and I and another guy started Tales Of Wo a while back, but I&#39;ve let it languish. Well, I&#39;ve begun working my way back into WebObjects, and with this new found energy comes new desire to share it with whomever may care to read it. So, if you&#39;re learning WebObjects, want to, or just want to witness me floundering from time to time, hop on over to Tales Of WO.
