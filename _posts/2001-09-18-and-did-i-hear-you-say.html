Today&#39;s song: Midnight Oil, <a href="http://www.venco.com.pl/~zuzanka/moil/earth.html#2">My Country</a>.<p>

&quot;And did I hear you say<br />
My country right or wrong<p>

Did you save your face<br />
Did you breach your faith<br />
Women, there were children at the shelter<br />
Now who can stop the hail<br />
When human senses fail<br />
There was never any warning, no escape&quot;</p></p>
