*Sigh*. Some script-kiddie decided one exploit per Outlook/IIS worm was not enough, so they&#39;ve bundled 12 or so exploits into <a href="http://www.channel2000.com/sh/technology/stories/national-technology-96428120010918-110923.html">one worm</a>. Lovely. Don&#39;t you guys have anything better to do? <p>

Hey Microsoft - why do you insist on designing products that are this vulnerable? And tell your spokesdrones that we all think they&#39;re full of s**t when they spin this as the latest &quot;Internet worm&quot; or &quot;email virus&quot;. No one is fooled any longer. This is a &quot;Microsoft internet&quot; worm, and a &quot;Microsoft email&quot; virus. But then, you&#39;ve always acted in your own self interest, even when (or especially when) everyone else gets the shaft in the process.</p>
