In <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/683">Up For Air</a>, I commented that I could only absorb Dave McCusker&#39;s writings in short bursts. I&#39;ve been following him more closely the last couple days, practicing as it were. I can &quot;hold my breath&quot; in his parallel universe for longer now - a couple weeks worth of postings. Maybe one day I&#39;ll be able to breathe there?
