Oh God, what&#39;s happening to me? <p>

I&#39;ve never cared a whit about professional sports, baseball especially. But when I saw <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20011028/sp/bbo_world_series_22.html">this link</a> via <a href="http://www.scripting.com">Scripting News</a>, I could not suppress a &quot;YYESss!!!&quot;<p>

What have I become?</p></p>
