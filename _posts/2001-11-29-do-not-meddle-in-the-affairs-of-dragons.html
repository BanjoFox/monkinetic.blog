<a href="http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/newNov01.htm#27nov01-ketchup">David spots</a> a great bumper sticker: 
<blockquote>&quot;Avoid meddling in affairs of dragons<br />for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup.&quot;</blockquote>
Some of my readers may not know this is a clever send-up of a famous quote from J. R. R. Tolkien&#39;s classic &quot;Fellowship Of The Ring&quot;:
<blockquote>&quot;Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.&quot;</blockquote>
