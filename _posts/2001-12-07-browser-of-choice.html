Looks like <a href="http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/0112/06.omniweb.php">some people</a> are still trying to build a better browser. &quot;With OmniWeb 4.1 you should see some major improvements in compatibility and speed. Our goal is that OmniWeb can be your Mac OS X browser of choice for 100 percent of the web sites you visit.&quot; Good on&#39;ya, Omni.
