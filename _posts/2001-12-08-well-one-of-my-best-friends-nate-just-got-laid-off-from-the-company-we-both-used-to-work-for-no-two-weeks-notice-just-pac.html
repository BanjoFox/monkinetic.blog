Well, one of my best friends <a href="http://www.nullgel.com">Nate</a> just got laid off from the <a href="http://www.compass.net">company</a> we both <i>used</i> to work for. No two weeks notice, just &quot;pack up and leave&quot;. They&#39;ve never been great about dealing with their employees, but this is just rotten. Two weeks before Christmas. <p>

I&#39;m so sorry Nate.</p>
