<a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/2002/01/08">Wes</a>: &quot;I know I&#39;d like to be able to easily link iPhoto into Manila; currently it takes a lot of clicks to get photos into this site.&quot;<p>

Wes hits on a great idea I had not thought of. I would love, too, to be able to script iPhoto to build a page on my site via <a href="http://www.free-conversant.com">Conversant</a>&#39;s extensive XML-RPC interface.</p>
