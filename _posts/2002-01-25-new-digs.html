Jodi talks about the new house we just signed a contract on (woo-hoo!), and laments the lack of information on the <a href="http://weblogs.userland.com/the259diaries/">site for our previous house</a>. Sorry folks, that&#39;s the way it happens sometimes.<p>
Seriously - as Jodi asays, we&#39;ll try and get some pics up somewhere of the old place, and of the new place once we&#39;re moving in. It&#39;s a great place, and we got a good deal on it.</p>
