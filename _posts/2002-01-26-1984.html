If you&#39;re a Mac user, or curious about the legendary &quot;1984&quot; ad for the introduction of the Macintosh, <a href="http://www.isd.net/cmcalone/1984.html">check out the history here</a>. (That <i>60 second</i> SuperBowl ad cost Apple $800k, almost as much as the ad itself - $900k.)<p>
The ad almost didn&#39;t run, the board of directors hated it and almost fired Chiat/Day (the famous ad agency that was doing Apple marketing then and created the ad), and Steve Wozniak almost put up half the $800k himself just to make sure it ran. Wild.</p>
