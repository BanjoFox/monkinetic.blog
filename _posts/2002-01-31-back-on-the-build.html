Well, after killing bugs for a few weeks, I&#39;ve got to get back on getting our build process in place. Not the whole thing yet, but I&#39;ve got to suck the code out of CVS, build a key framework, then do the same for the app. <p>
Thank goodness for <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit.html">BBEdit</a>, which makes editing shell scripts a highly pleasurable process. (Or as pleasurable as shell script can be).</p>
