One of the things Wes linked to in our conversation last night (how&#39;s that for mixing metaphors) was <a href="http://www.bitkeeper.com/">BitKeeper</a>, a distributed source code management tool. I&#39;m looking over the site now; I&#39;d like personal comments from  people with experience working with it, too.
