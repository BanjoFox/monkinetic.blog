<a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/">Doc Searls</a> has been through some of the same connection hell that we have with <a href="http://www.cox.net/">Cox.Net</a>. He&#39;s still <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2002/02/01#anotherCoxSuckerStory">upbeat</a> about it, while we&#39;re pretty frustrated. I&#39;m going to try some of his sugggestions, however, and try to remain calm.
