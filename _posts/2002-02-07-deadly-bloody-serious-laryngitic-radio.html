Wow. Garth Kidd has a <a href="http://www.deadlybloodyserious.com/throat/2002/02/07.html">hacked-together process</a> worthy of <a href="http://www.rube-goldberg.com/html/mail%20a%20letter.htm">Rube Goldberg</a> that lets him record his ramblings to mp3, and have them posted to his <a href="http://www.deadlybloodyserious.com/throat/">weblog</a>. Wow. Coooool.
