Linus Torvalds (if you care about this post you&#39;ll know who he is) has finally <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;selm=Pine.LNX.4.31.0202051928330.2375-100000%40cesium.transmeta.com">started using</a> <a href="http://bitkeeper.com/">BitKeeper</a>, which according to my conversation with Wes was explicitly designed to his specifications as a source-control tool. He has historically avoided any sort of source-control (eg CVS), which is really ironic if you think about it [<a href="http://slashdot.org/">/.</a>]
