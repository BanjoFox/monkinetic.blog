Hopefully next week I&#39;ll write up a quick summmary of my experiences with CSS so far. Much thanks to <a href="http://www.designweenie.com/blog">James Spahr</a> and <a href="http://diveintomark.org">Mark Pilgrim</a> for their help and advice. James even took my monkey-wrenched stylesheet and untwisted it for me - including comments! Woohoo!
