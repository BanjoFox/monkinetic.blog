Mark Pilgrim has posted an Accessibility statement for his <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/archive-022002.html#21">site</a>.<p>

I&#39;ve been thinking about this for a while now; maybe at some point I&#39;ll implement some of the things he has. I particularly like the &quot;next&quot; &quot;previous&quot;, &quot;home&quot; and &quot;top&quot; buttons in Mozilla that are enabled when browsing Mark&#39;s archives - this is because he&#39;s added the appropriate meta-data to his pages. Thank goodness for Content Management Systems.</p>
