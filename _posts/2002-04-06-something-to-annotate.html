Esther Dyson is quoted on <a href="http://www.evhead.com/archives/2002_04_01_arch.asp#75083885">Evhead</a>: 
 <blockquote>&quot;A conference is always an attempt to orchestrate. Now, it is also something to annotate.&quot;</blockquote>
Lately I&#39;ve had this whole annotation thing stuck in the back of my head. Inspired perhaps by the W3C&#39;s <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/">Annotea</a>, or perhaps by the semantic-web brainwashing I&#39;ve been receiving over on <a href="http://blogspace.com/swhack/chatlogs/">#swhack</a>, I&#39;ve been hacking on a python app (cgi for now) that will one day let you annotate this site with related links. If, of course, I ever finish it.
