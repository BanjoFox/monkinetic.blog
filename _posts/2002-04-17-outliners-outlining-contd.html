Note to <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/04/16#l1bb7976275c8fb839a2df96a4370343a">Dave </a> - Mark may have said he does not like outliners; however, he DOES understand the <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/04/16.html#outlines_vs_outliners">power of an outliner</a>:
<blockquote>I like to edit Python code in an IDE (or in Emacs in python-mode), which autoindents for me and allows me to &quot;fold&quot; code blocks (collapse an outline node) that I&#39;m not currently using.</blockquote>
He&#39;s already got what you&#39;re offering him in Radio&#39;s outliner (the one Frontier programmers all love)- but without the ability to easily edit that same script in some other text editor.
