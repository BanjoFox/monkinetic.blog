Tim Berners-Lee at the <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-pyth7.html">10th International Python Conference</a>: <blockquote>His proposal created a native graph data type that looked a bit like dictionaries, but allowed for storage of triples to represent a graph. He proposed a syntax like:<br /><br />

<code>x = {sky color blue,gray; madeof air. sea color grey. gray sameAs grey}</code>
<br /><br />
From the above, we would have five arcs: sky color blue, sky color gray, sky madeof air, sea color grey, and gray sameAs grey. We would then be able to perform simple queries on the graph.</blockquote>

This would be really cool to see - languages beginning to adopt the high-level concepts that will make it easy for developers to express complex information efficiently.
