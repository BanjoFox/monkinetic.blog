If you use Mac OS X, you simply <i>must</i> get <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/">Launchbar</a>, from <a href="http://www.obdev.at/">Objective Devlopment</a>. I&#39;ll not rant more now, just get over to Objective Development and get it. $19.95, and the best shareware you&#39;ll buy. Do it simple, do it right.
