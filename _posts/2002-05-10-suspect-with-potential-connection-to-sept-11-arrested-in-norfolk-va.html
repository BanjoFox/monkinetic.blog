<blockquote>A suspect in an alleged scheme to obtain fraudulent student visas had flight manuals, a drawing of a plane striking one of the World Trade Center towers and a date book with a lone entry: Sept. 11, according to court documents.</blockquote>
Norfolk, Va, is one of the 5 cities in my home town area of Hampton Roads. Wow. Very scary.
