I called Apple, the TiBook is still under warranty. I could buy a per-incident plan ($50/incident), let them talk me through checking that the dead pixels <i>really are</i> a hardware problem, then likely not pay for the incident. 

Or, I can give them $350 for a 3 year AppleCare plan, that covers phone support and troubleshooting for software and hardware. 

Third option: take it to the local Apple Retail store or Apple reseller. That&#39;s likely the way I&#39;ll go. Whichever way, I&#39;ll probably end up having to send the TiBook back to Apple for some TLC.
