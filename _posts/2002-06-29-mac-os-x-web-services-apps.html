Brent is <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=2032">thinking about</a> creating a mailing list for Mac OS X application developers who are working in the area of webservices, specifically desktop apps for web services. I think this is a great idea, and will help show others what a great platform Mac OS X is!

If you&#39;re working on a desktop web-services app for OS X, let Brent know if you&#39;d be interested in this.
