Thanks of course to the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">imdb</a>, I recently discovered that the original <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0066026">M*A*S*H movie</a> was directed by <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Altman,+Robert">Robert Altman</a>. We recently saw <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0280707">Gosford Park</a>, another Altman movie. It was excellent - see it. Heh - M*A*S*H makes more sense now than it did at the time, knowing Altman directed it.
