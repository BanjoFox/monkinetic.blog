<a href="http://up_yours.blogspot.com/">Dawn Olsen</a> <a href="http://up_yours.blogspot.com/2002_08_18_up_yours_archive.html#80538684">found this site</a> via <a href="http://redmonk.net/archives/2002/08/21/got-a-revolution-behind-my-eyes/">my post</a> about the Lo Fi Allstars it would seem. Not sure, but Dawn seems a bit enamoured. -) 

Sorry, ladies, I&#39;m <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net">taken</a>! I worked long and hard for her, and after I had given up, she came and got me! Talk about a fortunate turn of events! Love ya Jo!
