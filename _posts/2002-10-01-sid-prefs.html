I&#39;m seriously considering implementing an application preferences system in Sid, using Apple&#39;s built in NSUserDefaults system. Candidates for prefs:
<li>Load conversation labels when opening the document</li>
<li>Open most recent document upon application launch</li>
<li>Enable/disable spell check</li>

There are other things I&#39;m sure. Once you head down the path of parameterization, there&#39;s no going back...
