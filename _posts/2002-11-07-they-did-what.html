Back in &#39;93 or so, I was injured in a construction accident (12 penny nail to the knee) and had to have orthoscopic surgery. Before the surgery I was drugged up. I never thought about what happened after that until chatting with <a href="http://www.romanvenable.net/">Clark Venable</a> today. Clark is an anesthesiologist at Penn State, and I asked him if there had been an anesthesiologist present. He said yes, and pointed me to an <a href="rtsp://128.118.32.5/instructional/lma_ISDN_S.mov">instructional video</a> (streaming QuickTime) describing the breathing tube they most likely used. Um, wow! They stuck that thing in me? Geez.

Interesting though.
