<a href="http://danbricklin.com/">Dan Bricklin</a> (of VisiCalc fame) just bought a TablePC and <a href="http://danbricklin.com/log/tabletpc.htm">shares his thoughts</a> on it. Here&#39;s <a href="http://www.acer.com/APP/AKC/INTERNET/AACPubli.nsf/HeadingPagesDisplay/ProductsTablet+PC?OpenDocument&amp;ML1.3&amp;">Acer&#39;s version</a>, and here&#39;s <a href="http://www.csd.toshiba.com/cgi-bin/tais/pc/pc_tabletPcDetail.jsp?comm=CS">Toshiba&#39;s</a> (which Dan actually bought).

Looking at these really makes me wish <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> would release a TabletMac. With their Newton expertise (hire them back, guys!) and Mac OS X&#39;s inkwell features, I think they could turn out a very powerful device.
