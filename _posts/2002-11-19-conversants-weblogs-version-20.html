<blockquote>[via <a href="http://www.truerwords.net/index">Truer Words</a>]  <p>Conversant&#39;s Weblog 2.0 plugin is finally ready for very early pre-release testing. I&#39;m going to call this &quot;alpha&quot; testing, instead of beta, as many features -- ones that haven&#39;t been discussed outside of Macrobyte -- have not yet been fully implemented.</p>...
<p>
Work on the plugin up to this point has been all about making it work <b>right</b>, and making it <b>powerful</b>. Making it <b>fast</b> comes last.</p> (<a href="http://www.truerwords.net/2602">link</a>)</blockquote>
Mmmmmm, can&#39;t wait!
