Graphic Design: <a --="--" href="&lt;!--#enclosure filename=" linkonly="true" pubmed.jpg"="pubmed.jpg&quot;" urlonly="true">&quot;&gt;<img --="--" linkonly="true" pubmed_small.jpg"="pubmed_small.jpg&quot;" src="&lt;!--#enclosure filename=" urlonly="true" />&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;201&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;</a>Graphical diagram illustrating application architecture to non-technical audience.


I was asked by Clark Venable, a member of Penn State&#39;s medical center to provide a technical illustration of a software system to be used in a publication for a non-technical audience. After discussing the system with him I worked up a simple layout in OmniGraffle, a diagramming tool from Omni Group. We went back and forth a few times as we worked out the details and Clark expounded on the system&#39;s functionality and I reworked the illustration. After completion, it was decided that the diagram would also be used in an upcoming PowerPoint presentation.
