Today I&#39;m updating the redmonk.net website, and refocusing it at the same time.

Having succumbed (like many) to the death of the new economy, I&#39;ve been seeking employment for some time now. During this time I&#39;ve managed to find a few people who need my services as a web designer, developer, and general tech brainstormer. In the hopes of attracting more of the same, I&#39;m repurposing redmonk.net as my professional face - my personal weblog will be moving to <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic">monkinetic</a> shortly.

So please pardon the mess around here for a little while as I get things settled.
