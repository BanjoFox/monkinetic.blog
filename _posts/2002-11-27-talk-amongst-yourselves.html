I finally finished the redesign of the discussion section on this site, now residing in its <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/discussion/">own area</a> of redmonk, rather than <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/topics">strewn</a> <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/discuss">about</a> the root.

Getting the CSS right while fighting Chimera&#39;s cached pages about made me crazy, but I got it!
