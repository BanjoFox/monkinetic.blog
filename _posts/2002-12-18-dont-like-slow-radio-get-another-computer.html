<a href="http://live.curry.com/2002/12/17.html">Adam Curry</a> is having performance problems with <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio Userland</a>, too. (Adam is on Mac OS X I believe). <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/12/17#When:1:14:57AM">Dave&#39;s  suggestion</a>:

<blockquote>Or get a second computer for the myrid of background tasks running on your behalf. I&#39;m about to do that myself.</blockquote>

So the answer to Radio&#39;s performance issues is to <i>get another computer (and another copy of Radio)?</i> That&#39;s some kind of messed up logic. Fix the app, Dave.
