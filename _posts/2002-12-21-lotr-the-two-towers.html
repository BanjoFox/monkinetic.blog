Well, Jodi and I saw the new <a href="http://www.lordoftherings.net">Lord Of The Rings</a> movie, The Two Towers, yesterday. It was great. Amazing, actually. There were a few discrepancies from the book, but none that I thought really detracted from the story. More action, darker, faster moving - like the book.

I was also <a href="http://www.lordoftherings.net/effects/">reading on the LOTR site</a> about the MASSIVE system used for the armies in the movie. Incredible. (Ok, technically I was watching, not reading, as it&#39;s all video...)
