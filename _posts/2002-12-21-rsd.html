I&#39;ve been following the development of Daniel Berlinger&#39;s <a href="http://archipelago.phrasewise.com/RSD"><acronym title="Really Simple Discoverability">RSD</acronym> spec</a> pretty closely, since I&#39;m the author of a weblog editor called Sid. I imagine my users (both of them!) will want RSD support (I know I do).

I&#39;m really glad to see that Seth has got RSD support <a href="http://www.truerwords.net/2694">built into Conversant</a> now, both for the old weblogs and the new plugin.
