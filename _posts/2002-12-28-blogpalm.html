<a href="http://allied.blogspot.com/2002_12_22_allied_archive.html#90092584">Jeneane Sessum is looking</a> for a palmtop device that is designed for blogging. In the comments, someone suggests <a href="http://www.danger.com/">Danger</a>&#39;s HipTop (sold by T-Mobile as the SideKick).

This is indeed the future or palmtop devices: always-on internet connection that is not metered (although your phone minutes are) web browser, email and chat clients. Everything the mobile blogger needs. Also includes a simple digital camera that attaches to the device to let you upload images.

&lt;homer&gt;MMMMMmmmmm, Danger.&lt;/homer&gt;
