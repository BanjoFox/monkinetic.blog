Following a <a href="http://www.megnut.com/archive.asp?which=2003_01_01_archive.inc#002416">megnut link</a> about a job listing Meg posted to Craig's List, I found that the <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/">Craig's List</a> site is really cool. It seems to be a site that allows the creation of online communities - there's a big one for <a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/">New York</a>, one for <a href="http://phoenix.craigslist.org/">Phoenix</a>, etc. I think I'm going to add this site to my collection of places to look for jobs. I noticed that the few postings I looked at were written in a person's voice - not the Recruiter-droid&trademark; lingo you hear on most other job sites.

Anyway, interesting site - take a look for a Craig's list site for your town.

BTW - the megnut post is <a href="http://www.megnut.com/archive.asp?which=2003_01_01_archive.inc#002416">right on</a>.
