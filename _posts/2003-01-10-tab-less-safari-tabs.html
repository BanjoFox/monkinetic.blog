<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001103/">JY</a> posts an <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001103/2003/01/09.html#a1007">interesting idea</a> for <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> that solves the problem (multiple browser views supported in one window) that tabbed-browsing tries to solve. I think this *is* more Apple-like than actual tabs would be, and I like the &quot;persistent-between-window-closes&quot; idea too.
