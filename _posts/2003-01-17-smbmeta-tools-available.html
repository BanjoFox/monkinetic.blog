Dan Bricklin wrote to point out that he kindly linked to this site on the SMBMeta <a href="http://www.trellixtech.com/otherssaying.html">What Others Are Saying</a> page. 

In related news, SMBMeta has its own site now, <a href="http://www.smbmeta.org/">smbmeta.org</a>. There&#39;s also a new <a href="http://www.smbmeta.org/tools.html">tools</a> page on that site with an smbmeta file generator, as well as a page where you can register your domain once you have sn smbmeta file available.
