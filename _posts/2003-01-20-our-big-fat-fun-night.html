Jodi, <a href="http://www.blueshoediaries.com">Angie</a>, some other friends and I all went out last night to see <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0259446">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</a>. It&#39;s the funniest movie I&#39;ve seen in ages. I was giggling through the whole movie, and quite a few times burst out laughing. It was awesome.
