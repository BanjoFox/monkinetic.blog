<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/02/17.html#a2298">Scoble</a>: <blockquote>Well, I&#39;ve had some sneaks behind the scenes (not official ones, though). Apple has some cool stuff coming this year to be sure -- including some desktop machines that are outperforming current Intel stuff.</blockquote>

Other than the fact that I&#39;d like to know Robert&#39;s definition of &quot;outperforms&quot;, I think this is <i>great</i>. Wonder what&#39;s up the black-turtle-necked &quot;Sleeves of Steve&quot;?
