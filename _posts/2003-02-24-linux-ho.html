Some day this week I&#39;m going to be receiving from the <a href="http://www.ups.com/">nice man in the brown truck</a> two largish packages. One contains a 17&quot; monitor, the other an old-ish IBM Z-Pro, with Dual Pentium-Pro 200s, 128 mb of RAM, and approx 6 gb of hard disk.

Also included are a couple Red Hat 8 CDs. All this from my long-time best friend, Don Murdoch (who does have a web site to which I would link somewhere out there, but even Google cannot find it).

Now, to decide what&#39;s going on that box before it gets ensconced in my closet...
