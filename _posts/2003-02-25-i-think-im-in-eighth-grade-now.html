Oy. For kicks I just downloaded a copy of <a href="http://www.weirdal.com/">Weird Al</a>&#39;s <a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/weirdalyankovic/ithinkimaclonenow.html">&quot;I think I&#39;m a clone now&quot;</a> (cheesy parody of Tiffany covering <a href="http://www.heartbeatz.de/albums/tiffany/itwan.htm">&quot;I think we&#39;re alone now&quot;</a>), and I swear I&#39;m back in art class in eighth grade. Freaky.
