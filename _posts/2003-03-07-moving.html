Dave is talking about <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/03/06#sinkingIn">preparing to move</a> across country. In October of 2001, I was <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/news/2001/10/9">doing the same thing</a>. There&#39;s something exciting, scary, and altogether bigger than oneself about moving to a new life. All the best, Dave!
