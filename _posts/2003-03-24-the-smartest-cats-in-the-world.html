<div style="float:right; font-face:Geneva; font-size:small;margin:3px;"><br /> Toby &amp; Lucy, looking harmless. Ha!</div>The last few nights, we&#39;ve been hearing strange sounds coming from the room where we have been putting the cats overnight. Toby and Lucy are lovable, but can be demanding and downright annoying when they want food and/or attention at 4:30 am.

So, we&#39;ve been shutting them in a spare bedroom with their food.

As I said, we&#39;ve been hearing strange noises from that bedroom the last few nights. I thought it sounded like they were playing with the door handle, which is a lever-style. However, the door handles are about 36&quot; off the floor, and I don&#39;t think they can reach them.

Anyway, last night they were being really persistent. After four or five instances of *bang* *rattle*... who should come trotting into our room but Lucy, calm as can be.

<i>Those cats figured out how to open the bedroom door.</i> And this is a door that opens <i>inward</i>. If I had not heard/seen it for myself, I wouldn&#39;t have believed it.

Next step is borrowing a digital video camera and getting this stunt on tape. -)
