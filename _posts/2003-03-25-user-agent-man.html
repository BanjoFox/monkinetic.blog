I&#39;ve been following my web server logs more closely lately, and NetNewsWire now has 4 of the 5 top spots in my Browser report, losing out only to Google. My top five user agents in descending order:<ol>
<li>Googlebot/2.1</li>
<li>NetNewsWire/1.0.1fc1</li>
<li>NetNewsWire/1.0.3b1</li>
<li>NetNewsWire/1.0fc1</li>
<li>NetNewsWire Lite/1.0.2</li>
</ol>

Go, NetNewsWire, Go!
