Clever, and interesting. Mike Sanders has posted a webloggers&#39; version of Stephen Covey&#39;s <i>7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i>. It&#39;s split into several different posts, so start from the list on <a href="http://interdependent.blogspot.com/2003_03_01_interdependent_archive.html#91058645">Ton&#39;s Interdependent Thoughts</a>.
