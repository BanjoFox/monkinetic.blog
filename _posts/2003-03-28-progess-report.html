<div style="float:right; margin-left:5"><a href="http://media.redmonk.net/images/gannt.png"><img --="--" src="&lt;!--#enclosure linkonly=" true"="true&quot;" urlonly="true" />&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;</a></div>Well, mygannt is coming along nicely. I&#39;m trying not to obsess about it, but... well, if you&#39;re a geek you understand. (Must... add... feature...)

I&#39;ve abracted the text drawing so I can draw wrapped text in a bounds box, and justify it top or bottom. (Cue INXS: &quot;Justify... Justifyyyy meee&quot;)

I also added support for milestones what indicate client decisions (the arrows and text above them), as well as tic marks indicating that days in each week (kinda eye candy, sorry).

Each phase (in my project plans) has a list of activities/tasks in that phase. These are now rendered above or below the phase banner, as determined by the banner&#39;s vertical position on the chart.
