Jodi has been posting more and more lately to her site. She&#39;s becoming quite the blogger. I knew it was inevitable when I heard her say the other day, with 5 minutes before walking out the door to work: &quot;I need to go post to my website...&quot;

You go girl. -)

She&#39;s a really good communicator, I think, and it&#39;s quite fun to watch her develop her &quot;voice&quot; in this new medium.

(If you&#39;re into that sort of thing, there&#39;s an RSS feed <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/index/rss">here</a>.)
