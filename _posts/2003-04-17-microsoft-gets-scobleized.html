Well, most everyone knows by now, Scoble&#39;s headed to Redmond to become an Evangelist for the next version of Windows. I have mixed feelings about this - I&#39;ve gotten a chance to chat with Robert a lot recently, and I have a feeling that&#39;s going to change (because he&#39;s going to be even busier and because he&#39;s now under the Mother-Of-All-Non-Disclosure-Agreements). So I&#39;m a bit sad about that.

I&#39;m also simply conflicted about Microsoft. I dig Robert and respect him - if he&#39;s working for Microsoft then I believe they (at least) said the right things. But as a Mac user, I fear Microsoft and the &quot;destroy all opposition&quot; meta-goal. I say meta-goal since I believe that there are very few (if any) MS employees who actually have malevolent intentions on the industry. I imagine 99.9% of them just want to make the world a better place, and get Microsoft software running anywhere they can.

It&#39;s the higher-level (meta) effect of 100,000 cheerful geniuses working to get Microsoft software running on every computer in the world that scares me.
