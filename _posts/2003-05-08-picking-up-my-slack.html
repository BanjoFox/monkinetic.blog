Jodi, dear that she is, has been picking up my blogging slack lately over on . She&#39;s covered our visit to Paulo Soleri&#39;s <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/index/2003/05/06#item172">Arcosanti</a>, my mom&#39;s plans for an <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/index/2003/05/06#item171">Ivy Family portal</a>, as well as a site of her own, and she&#39;s <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/index/2003/05/07#item174">reviewed X-Men 2</a>, which we saw yesterday (hint- it rocked!). If posting seems slack here,  for the latest!
