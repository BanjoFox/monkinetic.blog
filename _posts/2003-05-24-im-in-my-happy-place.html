Thanks to Weird Al, I&#39;m in my happy place, listening to <a href="http://www.weirdal.com/latenews.htm#albumnews">Al doing</a> the Backstreet Boys singing about EBay, Eminem rhyming about TV, and Avril Levine crooning over cheese pizza, kissing cousins, and roller coasters... 

<i>Muahahahahahaaa heheee hahaaa...</i>

Particularly joy-worthy: Hardware Store, A Complicated Song, and EBay. smile
