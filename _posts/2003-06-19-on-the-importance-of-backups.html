A couple days ago, a borked config file led me to believe that I had completely hosed my OpenACS setup. I ened up re-installing openacs and the database schema. Luckily, I backed up the templates and some scripts I had customized, so as I get sections of my install backonline I&#39;m mostly able to do it quickly.

Always make backups!
