Jodi and I are in Jacksonville, Fla. helping our with Jodi&#39;s grandmother who is recovering from surgery and fighting a battle with cancer. It&#39;s a hard experience for the family, watching someone who has been (and is) so respected and loved fight such pain. I&#39;m posting from Jdi&#39;s grandmother&#39;s AOL connection (56k again!) but I should be on in the complex&#39;s computer lab tomorrow (broadband!)

See ya&#39;ll then.
