Good grief. Dell has taken the &quot;wait-for-Apple&#39;s-success-then-clone-it&quot; strategy <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/2003-09-25-dell-cover_x.htm">a bit too far</a> with it&#39;s new Digital Jukebox (&quot;DJ&quot; heh).

The smooth white case, the two-color scrollwheel-powered menu system - remind you of <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">anything</a>?
