The web designer&#39;s online magazine <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a> has redesigned and relaunched again, and man, is it nice. Gone are the shocking-orange and reds and yellows, this time around it&#39;s a subtle mix of modern and painterly styles. Very nice.

And of course, there&#39;s several great techical articles on <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/randomizer/">easy image rotation</a>, <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/slidingdoors/">CSS</a>, and <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fir/">accessibility</a>.
