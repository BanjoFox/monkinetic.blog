Having, with <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Panther</a>, gotten a command-line with <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20031027145026892&amp;mode=print">easy to turn on</a> coloring of directory listings, I went in search of something that would tell me what colors I could use. 

I found the resource I needed, of course, in the <a href="http://www.omc.net/cgi-sys/man.cgi?section=1&amp;topic=ls">ls(1) man page</a>.

BTW, my LSCOLORS variable is now <code>cxfxhxhxbxhxhxBxbxdxdx</code>, and looks like:

<div align="center"></div>
