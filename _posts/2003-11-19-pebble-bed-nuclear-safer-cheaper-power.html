Cool article about cheap, and potentially much safer nuclear power. I hope this takes off; I&#39;m no enviro-nut, but I believe in making best use ouf our resources. Burning a gazillion tons of oil-rock a year (using only a part of the mass of the coal and dumping the rest into the breatho-sphere) strikes me as very obviously stupid.

If this new form of reactor can make nuclear power safer and cheaper, then build the dang thing and let&#39;s get on with the jet-packs and flying cars already.
