I&#39;m listening to mid-vintage U2 today: Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum. Eventually I&#39;ll get to early-vintage: War, Boy, October. October is my fav of the early stuff: I spent many hours as a teen learning The Edge&#39;s guitar licks on Gloria on an old classical guitar. (Slipping into nostalgia...)
