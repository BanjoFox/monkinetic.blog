&gt;In Japan if you develop software that MIGHT be used to violate copyright laws you can be charged with a crime and be arrested. Yet, in the USA, if you manufacture guns that MIGHT be used to kill someone you are essentially immune from criminal prosecution...

Interesting observation. I guess it all depends on where the money is. The Money knows neither hypocrisy nor irony.
