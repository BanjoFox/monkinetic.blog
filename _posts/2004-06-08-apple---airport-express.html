Whoa! Apple announces <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/">AirPort Express</a>, a power-supply-shaped AirPort base station with a new technology called <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/airtunes.html">AirTunes</a> - it will wirelessly stream your itunes to your stereo by way of a 1/8&quot; stereo output jack. Drool factor 5, Mr. Sulu!!

Update: <a href="http://www.macworld.com/">MacWorld</a> has a bit on how <a href="http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/editors/archives/000212.php">AirTunes</a> works.
