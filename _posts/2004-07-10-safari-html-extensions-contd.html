Dave Hyatt blogs about <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_07.html#005951">the solution he chose</a> for the extensions Apple is making to (X)HTML to support the new features in Safari and Dashboard. I think he chose the right solution and it&#39;s fun to see the conversation played out in the public space.
