I added a new feature to monkinetic today: &quot;On This Day In [year]&quot;. In the right column I&#39;ve now got links to past years on monkinetic when there were posts on the current day&#39;s date. I&#39;ve always liked the feature on Dave&#39;s <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/dir/davesWorld/onThisDayIn">Scripting News</a>, and thought I&#39;d finally implement it here. I think it adds a sense of time and history that is really cool.
