Jodi and I managed to pick up a few more movies of interest today at <a href="http://costco.com/">Costco</a>, listed herewith:

<dl>
<dt><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0120888/">The Wedding Singer</a></dt>
<dd>I cannot believe it took us this long to obtain this classic.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0138524/">Intolerable Cruelty</a></dt>
<dd>Part of a two-pack with the next film on the list, this Coen-brothers film is one of theirs I&#39;ve liked most, though I still must get <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0110074/">The Hudsucker Proxy</a>. &quot;You know, for kids!&quot;</dd>
<dt><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0335266/">Lost In Translation</a></dt>
<dd>One might think <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0001068/">Sophia Coppola</a> had been taking lessons from <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000265/">Robert Altman</a>, this movie has so little plot. And yet I really liked it, if for nothing else than the amazing atmosphere Coppola creates and the sense of culture shock that she conveys. (One of these days I should post about experiencing culture shock.)</dd>
