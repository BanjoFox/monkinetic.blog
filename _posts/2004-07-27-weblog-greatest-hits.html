<a href="http://joi.ito.com/">Joi Ito</a> links to a <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2004/07/are_blogs_backw.html">post by Seth Godin</a> who mentions the idea of &quot;greatest hits&quot;, or weblog posts that you (as the blogger) think people should read first when coming to your site.

&gt;I think that making a &quot;greatest hits&quot; page easier to create makes sense. I personally like wiki pages for that sort of thing, but I could imagine it being built into a tool. Another thing people do is to put a sidebar section of favorite items and permalink from there.

Interesting idea, and I think this would be pertty easy to accomplish in WP with 1) a custom field for favorite posts - say &quot;fav&quot;, set to 1, true, or &quot;oh yeah baby&quot; - and 2) a small bit of SQL to pull the list of posts and link to them. Wonder if anyone wants to build it?
