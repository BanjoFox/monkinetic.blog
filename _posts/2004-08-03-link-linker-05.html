Link Linker is a plugin for |WordPress| 1.2.

Link Linker lets you easily link to sites that are in your blogroll, links list, or other link categories defined in the Link Manager.

In a post, you can write the name of one of your links, surrounded by vertical pipes (&quot;|&quot;) and the plugin will strip the pipes and link the name to the URL listeed in the Links Manager. For example, if I write |WordPress|, it will get rendered as |WordPress|. (I&#39;ve created a &quot;linker fodder&quot; links category simply so I have a place to dump links that I want available to the plugin.

Caveat: As of version 0.5, the regex used for link names is: <code>/|([_a-zA-Z0-9-s]+)|/m</code>, so there is a limit on what you can name your links.
