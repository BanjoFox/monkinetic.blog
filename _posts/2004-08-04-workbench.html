I love having a wife who works for a construction company. Every so often |Jodi| will call me and say &quot;hey we&#39;ve got &lt;cool construction materials&gt; here for free if you want them&quot;. So the other day she calls and they&#39;ve got some cabinetry they&#39;re getting rid of. I went over and got a cabinet with a couple drawers and doors in it, and two shelves. After acquiring a 4x8 sheet of CDX plywood, and the judicous application of <a href="http://www.liquidnails.com/">Liquid Nails</a> and threaded fasteners, I managed to construct a very servicable workbench, replacing the lower half of an old credenza I&#39;d been using.

<div align="center"><a href="http://redmonk.net/mt/mt-static/uploads/newWorkbench.jpg" title="my  new workbench"><img alt="my new workbench" border="0" class="at-xid-6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b360ed970c" height="135" src="http://steveivy.typepad.com/.a/6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b360ed970c-pi" width="200" /></a></div>

It was a fun project, especially since Jodi came out and sat in a beach chair and read to me while I worked. I love being married!
