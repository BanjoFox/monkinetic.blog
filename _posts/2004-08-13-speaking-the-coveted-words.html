>I can't even begin to express how exciting it is to get to announce that in approximately 8-10 months Steve and I are finally going to be parents!!! ... Soon we will have a child to love and care for and laugh with and who will become a part of us.

We are so excited about adopting, and have been amazed and pleased at the outpouring of joy and encouragement from our family and friends!
