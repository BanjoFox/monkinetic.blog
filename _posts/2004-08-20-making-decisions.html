Jodi and I had a long conversation with a woman from the agency that is helping us prepare the dossier that gets sent to Ukraine for consideration. Cheri is a real sweetheart, and has a huge love for these kids. We&#39;re having to face some really tough questions regarding what kind of child we&#39;re looking to adopt and what sort of medical conditions we&#39;re willing to accept as part of that. The flux of emotions can be overwhelming -- something I had expected, but going through it is so different from imagining it.
