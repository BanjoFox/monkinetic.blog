|Jodi| is still blogging <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/archives/2004/10/30/adoption-process-week-12">our adoption process</a>, and she&#39;s turning into quite the blogger!! I know I&#39;m biased, but Jodi is quite a good writer, and she&#39;s finding her &quot;blog voice&quot; over time. You go girl!
