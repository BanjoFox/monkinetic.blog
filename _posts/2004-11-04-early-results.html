On a bright note, it looks like my brother <a href="http://jediwannabe.com">Sean</a> and his wife Amy may get some early results, even if the rest of the nation won&#39;t. New family member Jesse Ethan Ivy looks like he&#39;s going to make an early appearance. Here&#39;s hoping for an easy and quick delivery, and safety for mom and child!
