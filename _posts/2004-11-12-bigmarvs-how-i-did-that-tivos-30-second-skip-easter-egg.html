BigMarv&#39;s How I Did That: <a href="http://www.bigmarv.net/how/tivo30secondskip.html">Tivo&#39;s 30 Second Skip Easter Egg</a>:
&gt;&quot;As it turns out, a 30 second skip is buried within the programming of the TiVo device and can be brought to the surface using an Easter Egg. After enabling the 30 second skip feature, The skip-to-hash button becomes a 30 second skip button. Once you begin using this feature, you&#39;ll wonder how you ever lived without it.&quot;
