This snippet from <a href="http://www.postmodernclog.com">Le Sabot Post-Moderne</a> explained for me why many people in Russia, Ukraine, and other post-soviet states continue to support, even elect, strongman (read near-dictatorial) leaders like Putin and Yanukovych:

&gt;There is a large segment of the population who thinks Ukraine took a wrong turn with Independence and the death of Communism. They may not want the hammers &amp; sickles back, but they do want a strong man at the top who will set things straight -- a Putin. This goes double for those who have &quot;lost&quot; during the post-Soviet period -- pensioners, miners, factory workers, the military and security forces, and many government bureaucrats and workers. *These are people who were raised to desire order at all cost*, and they see the present period as chaotic and scary. Yanukovych, for all his faults, radiates a brutish strength and promises order, however bleak.

[Emphasis mine]
