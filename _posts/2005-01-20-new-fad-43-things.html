&gt;Discover what&#39;s important, make it happen, share your progress. Find your 43 things.

Oh brother, <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/view/redmonk">something new</a> to waste my time.

<a href="http://www.43things.com/">43 Things</a> is a site that lets you post things you want to do, and tell others things you&#39;ve done, and if they were worth doing. Sounds silly, but it&#39;s oddly addictive.

Pete at Rasterweb posted several things he does NOT want to do (<a href="http://rasterweb.net/raster/2005/01/18/43-crazy-things/">43 Crazy Things</a>), and wondered if anyone would do them. Sadly, I&#39;ve already done 2 of them, including <a href="http://www.43things.com/things/view/26003">getting shot in the leg</a> and <a href="http://www.43things.com/things/view/26006">totaling my car</a>. Geez.

UPDATE: I&#39;ve added a pic to the &quot;total my car&quot; entry. Thanks <a href="http://ivyfamily.net">Mom</a>!
