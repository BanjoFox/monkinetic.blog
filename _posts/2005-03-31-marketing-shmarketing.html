&gt;&quot;Marketing, shmarketing. I say, bash away on java as much as possible. I dont know exactly what problems people are having pushing openacs to clients, but I have found that getting the initial project spec, taking it home, and coming back with their project 60% completed in two days is a lot stronger marketing tactic than saying &#39;well yes, it will take 6 months to build you a bulletin board, but your system will have an object-relational persistance layer and full J2EE compliance.&#39;&quot;<br />-- Rzolf
