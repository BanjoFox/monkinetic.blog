Because I&#39;m always trying and failing to *get things done*, I&#39;m investigating the <a href="http://www.davidco.com/individuals.php">latest in productivity memes</a>. Gad, I&#39;ll try just about anything if it&#39;ll help.

Update: I just purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142000280/merlinsblog-20">the book</a> from Amazon. For $10, it&#39;s worth buying so I can mark it up, etc as I read. If I end up not pursuing it further, I can pass it on only having spent $10.
