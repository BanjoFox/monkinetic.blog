I&#39;ve got a bee in my bonnet to figure out a good way to implement a simple tagging scheme like the one used by <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>. My particular question is, is it better to leave the tags in a text field and union them on the fly, or do some sort of pre-processing into an intermediate state before querying them?
