I just saw one of the new <a href="http://www.napster.com/">Napster</a> commercials. Slogan: &quot;Own Nothing, Have Everything&quot;. They even do that cliche&#39;d &quot;brain-washing&quot; Outer Limits thing.

Another version: &quot;Hello friend. You don&#39;t need to own music to discover music. To love music. To enjoy music.&quot;

Interesting. This is the world the music industry wants us to live in.
