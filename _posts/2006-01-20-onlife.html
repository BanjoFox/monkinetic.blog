OMG. Why did I not see this before? <a href="http://getonlife.com">OnLife</a>.

No time to write more, but if you like OnLife and spend time in VoodooPad, I created a <a href="http://redmonk.net/files/voodoopad.zip">scriptlet</a> for VoodooPad. Unzip and put the files into ~/Library/Application Support/OnLife/Scriptlets/. Restart OnLife to see the new  source in your list.

Update 01/23/2006: I&#39;ve put up a page for my <a href="http://redmonk.net/onlife-hacks">OnLife hacks</a>. Enjoy.
