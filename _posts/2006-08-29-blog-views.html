While reading [blogHelper](http://bloghelper.is-there.net/)&#39;s post about using [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) as a CMS, I noticed the menu of views in the upper right corner. You can select &quot;normal&quot; (blog style), &quot;discussions&quot; (most commented posts), &quot;book&quot; (all posts arranged into a hierarchical book structure), or &quot;best&quot; (highest rated posts). I thought this was a very clever and interesting way to expose users to various aspects of the content.
