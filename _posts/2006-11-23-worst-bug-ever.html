[Massive, giant, enormous, huge, terrifying, flesh-eating centipede](http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=605).

<img alt="horrible_bug.png" class="at-xid-6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b365d4970c" id="image2413" src="http://steveivy.typepad.com/.a/6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b365d4970c-pi" />

&gt;The giant centipede then grips the stone with it rear legs, allowing its forward segments to dangle into the cave below. Its front section sways as its legs wriggle through the air in search of the intended target: a passing bat.
