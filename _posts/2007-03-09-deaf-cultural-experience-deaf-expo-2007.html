##Deaf Cultural Experience

On Saturday, March 4, my wife and I went to the DeafNation Expo at the Phoenix downtown convention center.

We walked toward the hall, noting already how quiet it was. I started to note a few people standing around signing, and I tried to remember what I had learned about Deaf etiquette - don&#39;t stare unless you intend to introduce yourself! I was uncomfortable as we entered the lobby and headed toward the hall entry... folks all around were signing in rapid conversation. And I could not understand 99.5% of what was being said.

As we entered the hall, I felt very self-conscious - did I have a huge sign on my forehead that said &quot;Hearing Person&quot;? Surely everyone here could tell and resented my being here.
