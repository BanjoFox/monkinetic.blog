I had to uninstall my irc client at work because of security policy. Also, I needed an excuse to use a clever title derived from [Jonathan Coulton](http://jonathancoulton.com)&#39;s [PopSci Podcast On The Moon](http://www.popsci.com/popsci/whatsnew/2a97225814a2b010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html). *Thanks JoCo!*
