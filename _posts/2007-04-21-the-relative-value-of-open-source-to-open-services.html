[Chris Messina](http://factoryjoe.com/blog) posted an exploration of the whole [open source v. open services conversation](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2007/04/15/the-relative-value-of-open-source-to-open-services/). I&#39;m going to respond here in the near future, but wanted to point to it while it&#39;s fresh in my mind.

I have 6 or 7 blog posts waiting to be written, responding to Chris&#39; post is just one of them. *sigh*.
