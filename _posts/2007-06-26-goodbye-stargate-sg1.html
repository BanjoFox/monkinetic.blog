Jodi and I have been fans of the Stargate series (first SG1, then Atlantis) for years. This past Friday, Stargate SG1 ran it&#39;s final episode. I put off watching it, unwilling to say goodbye to a show that we&#39;ve grown to love over time. Last night we finally watched it, and it was fantastic. Much, much, better than I could have asked for, and to me, it struck all the right notes.

Goodbye, SG1. You will be missed.
