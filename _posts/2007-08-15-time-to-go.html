[Scott Adams lives in my house](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/08/basic-instruc-3.html):

>In my house, when it's "time to go" someplace, I put on my jacket and go stand near the door. Once there, time stands still. To me, "time to leave" means "go stand near the door". To other people, it signals the start of an infinite sequence of events that may or may not culminate in leaving.

:-P
