Tomorrow I have a guest strip featured on [Sheercore.com](http://sheercore.com) ([about](http://sheercore.com/about)) - I'm very excited, conversation with Matt always seems to end up with something quotable and this was no different.

So polish your swords, geeks, and watch out who you explain your latest hypothesis to.

Update: I'm published!
