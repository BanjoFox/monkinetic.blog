Just wanted to follow up my [post of the other day](http://redmonk.net/archives/2008/01/06/php-wordpress-ruby-and-diso/) with [a comment I just posted](http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2008/jan/10/hosts/#c50009) over on [The B List](http://www.b-list.org/weblog/).

>Just as Dreamhost offers a one-click install of Wordpress, I could see it offering one-click installation of an application on a pre-installed/configured framework system. If the process of uploading/configuring a module or theme can be made easy for the end-user/developer, then I think there's hope.
