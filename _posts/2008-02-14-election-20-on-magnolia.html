Sorry for the dearth of content here lately, but life has been a bit overwhelming. One link for you: I've started an [Election 2.0 group](http://ma.gnolia.com/groups/election20) over on [Ma.gnolia](http://ma.gnolia.com/) (*waves at Larry*), where I'm bookmarking "Links about new trends and ideas in election law, theory, and practice", as well as links relating to this year's election. It's a public group - feel free to join, contribute, and follow along. Please keep it on-track and respectful!
