>A little over three years ago, the web designer and online essayist Leslie Harpold died at age 40. Leslie was a friend of mine, part of a circle of early web creators who discovered the medium as it was blossoming in the mid-'90s. -- Rogers Cadenhead, [Why Leslie Harpold's Sites Disappeared](http://workbench.cadenhead.org/news/3579/why-leslie-harpolds-sites-disappeared)

Leslie was the first person I didn't already know to email me, back in '96 or '97, after somehow coming across [my personal corner of the ArtLab Europe website](http://static.monkinetic.com/files/oldsites/steve-artlab-1996/about.html). She was a gifted writer and someone who understood, more than most, what the Web would become.
