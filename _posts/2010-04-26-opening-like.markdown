Quick thought: What if instead of putting Facebook "Like" buttons on every site on the web, every authentication service could provide it's [own "like" service](http://openlike.org/) (or point to the "like" service of your choice)?. Then - to give the extreme example - if I used an OpenID service to log in to Facebook, the "like" on Facebook would be posted via *my* preferred "like" service? Hows *that* for Open?
