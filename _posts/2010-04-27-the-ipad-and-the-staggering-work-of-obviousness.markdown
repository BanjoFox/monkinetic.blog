>I wrote and edited this essay in its entirety on my iPad, using my Apple bluetooth keyboard, and the iPad Pages app, and posted using the Wordpress app. I only inserted the images on my Mac. It was awesome and reminded me of writing posts for my old Mac news site, circa 1998, on my Newton MessagePad. Sniff.
