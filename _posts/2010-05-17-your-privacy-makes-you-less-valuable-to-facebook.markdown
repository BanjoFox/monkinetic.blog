I've got a longer response in the works, but I thought this snippet from [Chris Messina's post about OpenID Connect](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2010/05/16/combing-openid-and-oauth-with-openid-connect/) was particularly insightful (and not even from the main point of this post):

>That is, because OpenID users share less information with third parties, they are perceived as being "less valuable" than email-based registrants or users that connect to their Facebook or Twitter accounts.

>So while it might seem like an inconvenience to custom-tailor your personal privacy settings on Facebook, the liberal defaults are meant to make Facebook users' accounts more valuable to relying parties than other, more privacy-preserving account configurations.
