Title: "If monkinetic Then app.net"
Date: 2013-02-04 12:41

I'm testing out a basic [IFTTT](http:/ifttt.com) recipe that reposts monkinetic posts to [my app.net account](https://alpha.app.net/sivy).

*Update: Sorry I didn't realize when I made the recipe that it was going to grab the last n existing posts and repost them as well. Whoops. Thankfully it only reposted the last 3 posts.*
