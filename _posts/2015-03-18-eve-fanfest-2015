Sigh.

I'm not a big gamer. In fact, I'm not a gamer at all right now. But for about 8 months I played [EVE Online](http://eveonline.com), the decade-plus-old MMORG of internets spaceships, and I got hooked. Even though I ran out of time and resources to play, I still follow along on Twitter and other social media and forums, especially the goings on in [Stay Frosty](http://stayfrostyeve.com/), my adopted piratey home.

This week is [Fanfest](http://fanfest.eveonline.com/en/default), the huge gathering of EVE players and [CCP Games](http://www.ccpgames.com/en/home), the company that makes EVE, all in Reykjavik, Iceland. . Excited to see what news comes out!
