My second day at PyCon, and the start of the actual conference.

Breakfast, show floor walking. Conversation with Openstack vendor, think `$DAYJOB` should commit to working off of Oslo messaging for event triggering. The new event/messaging system is not coming any time soon.

## Keynote: Catherine Bracy, Code for America

> In the words of a former boss, "Technology will f*** you".

Catherine speaks about how problems with technology intended to help (Healthcare.gov, Florida unemployment site, Arizona welfare site) end up hurting the populations they are meant to serve. we feel like government doesn't work, when we expect to be able to access the store of the world's knowledge from a device in our hands. It is dangerous for democracy and breeds cynicism when government does not work.

In 2015 that means that goverment must be able to do digitial services well. There is no Code Red team to come save us when things go bad.

**Stop Waiting for Permission** - Medium post: Code for America hackathon particpant who built new tools to help people know what the parking rules are in different parts of Philly.

**Detroit Water Project** - CFA Fellow built a system to enable people to assist others who need help paying their water bills in Detroit. Recently graduated Y Combinator. 

**Local Free Web** - find free internet access via text message based on bus stops.

Government can work in 21st century, but it means people who have the skills contributing to the tools and processes that need improvement.
