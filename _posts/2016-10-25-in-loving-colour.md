title: In Loving Colour
---

Back when I was mostly a designer, I discovered [Colour Lovers](http://www.colourlovers.com), a great palette-sharing website that helped my brainstorm my way through a lot of site designs.

In redesigning this blog recently, I found it again and was reminded how much I love color.
