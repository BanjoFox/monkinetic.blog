You know, the one where they slowly get their memories back, and drag some poor nearly helpless sidekick around while killing peole and making things right?

Yeah, it was the best!

No, not [that one](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258463/). Not [that one](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372183/) either, or [that one](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0440963/).

No, it's [THIS ONE, the Long Kiss Goodnight](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116908/). Greatest amnesiac assassin move ever. Geena F'ing Davis is the one-time assassin, and Samuel L. Jackson the nearly helpless (but not completely hopeless) private eye getting dragged all over, getting shot at and yelling a lot.

Watch it. Again.
