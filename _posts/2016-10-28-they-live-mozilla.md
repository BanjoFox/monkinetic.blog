title: They Live, Shepherd Fairey, and the Trolling of the Mozilla brand
---

Wonderful story from @jwz about the movie [They Live](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/) (creepy as hell in 1988), grafitti artist [Shepherd Fairey](https://www.obeygiant.com/), and how he got Mozilla to invest in a constructivist/futurist brand identity that called on Soviet imagery to promote Free Software.
