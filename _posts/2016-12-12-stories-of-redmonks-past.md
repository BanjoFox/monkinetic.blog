The post above describes how (7 years ago at this writing) I turned over the [redmonk.net](http://redmonk.net) domain to [RedMonk](http://redmonk.com), after a friendly *7-year conversation* with RedMonk's El Hefe, [James Governor](http://redmonk.com/team/james-governor/). His blog post on the occasion:

[7 Years To Secure A Domain Name: a tale of web identity](http://redmonk.com/jgovernor/2009/11/25/7-years-to-secure-a-domain-name-a-tale-of-web-identity-consolidating-redmonk-for-the-web-squared/)

> But he also mentioned he would consider a reasonable offer... whoa. This was a big big change. Consider a reasonable offer? Not just a flat out no? And it only took me seven years to weaken his resolve...

Wow, I've "known" James for 14 years? I'm a fossil.
