I'm playing EVE Online again, with wife approval (I found some $ in the budget and swore to keep playtime withinn reasonable limits...)!

I'm on the Twitters as [@estedestirr](https://twitter.com/estedestirr), and I'm flying with space monks (or hippies) in [Signal Cartel](https://www.eve-scout.com/signal-cartel/), part of the EVE-Scout alliance. See you in space!
