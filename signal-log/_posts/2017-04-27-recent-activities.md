As a relatively new player to EvE-Scout and exploration in general, how am I spending my EVE-time these days?

Generally, I've been in W-Space, focusing on C1s, 2s, and C3s where I might find [pirate faction relic sites](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Relic_and_data_sites#Pirate_sites) to run. C1s tend to have lots of sigs but also a HS static which means K-Space explorers (like me) find them quickly and run the sites, so I'm trying to focus on the C2s and 3s. With a CovOps frig (Helios with Angel Gala skin FTW) and decent scanning/hacking skills, I'm getting a lot better at finding and running these sites. I'm also considering making my way back to Gurista null (Venal) which I found manageable in terms of available sites with decent loot, and not overly crowded (except that pipe where Out of Sight lives).

Being an EvE-Scout pilot, I think I'm going to start carrying cache-tending supplies, so that when I come across a WH with an [ESRC rescue cache](http://evescoutrescue.com/esrc) I can make sure it's updated and ready to go. Be a good neighbor, and all that. :)

As many of our pilots end up in WH space from time to time, especially the ESRC pilots, [A Dead Parrot](https://evewho.com/pilot/A+Dead+Parrot) created an amazing co-pilot app named [Allison](http://104.131.59.55/data/eve) (temp location, and sorry - Signal Cartel pilots only!). Allison is an Aura-like companion that tracks your location in-game, and audibly tells you the name of the wormhole you've entered, the class, whether there is a rescue cache in the hole, and whether the cache needs tending (confirm that it exists, location, and contents). Allison also includes a link to the [Anoik.is](http://anoik.is) page for the hole, so you can check for recent activity, get information on the kinds of WH connections to expect, etc. She's an incredibly useful WH companion and is gaining new capabilities all the time!
