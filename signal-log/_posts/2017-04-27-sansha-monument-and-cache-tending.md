So I got some time over lunch today to scan a C1 I landed in last night. Two interesting things: A [Ruined Sansha Monument]() relic site, and Allison (EvE-Scout's WH companion) told me there was an EvE-Scout Rescue Cache in the system that needed tending.

After scanning and eiminating all the gas and data sites, I bookmarked the one HS wormhole and went about running the Sansha site. Not a huge haul - only about 9m total for about 10min work. As ticks go not great but not awful either.

Then came the fun part - learning about how to tend our one of our rescue caches. A Rescue Cache is a password-protected secured container anchored in a system, somewhere off-grid, with a probe launcher and probes for any explorers or other WH pilots who manage to get stuck sans same. (It happens more often than you might think, and even to seasoned WH dwellers.) So I got the instructions link from alliance chat and went about bouncing between celestials until I was close enough to see the cache on grid. Now, I'm not great at dropping bookmarks at warp yet, so it only took my like *500* (ok, really like 10-12) bounces to get close enough to see the cache on grid. But get there I did! I checked and confirmed the contents and then updated the site in the ESRC database. This is what being in EvE-Scout is about.
