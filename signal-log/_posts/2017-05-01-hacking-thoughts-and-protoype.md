While sitting in station in Zoohen this morning I started thinking (as I often do) about the system hacking we explorers have to do to access the abandoned data banks, monuments, and quarry sites that are the staple of our lifestyle and income. My tech 2 Relic Analyzer is a couple of months old, but the module design is ancient by New Eden standards. While the target mainframes are old systems, our analyzers don't have to be stuck in the flat grid we work in now. With ocular filters and cybernetic subprocessors and other related implants, capsuleers are capable of understanding and interfacing with much more advanced tools then we have now.

I brought up an image processor and mocked up (badly, I'm an explorer and hacker, not an artist) a new tool design: one that expands on the node display we use now but is capable of representing much more information by capturing and anlyzing the non-linear relationships between the nodes in multiple dimensions.

Due to the extra CPU/RAM required to capture, process, and analyze the datastream with all this new data we couldn't expect that this would replace our current hacking tools, but could be useful for the more esoteric situations. I've hypothesized that [Entosis Links](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Entosis_Link) may be more effective with a capsuleer hacking to assist the (quite complex) infiltration attempt before the mind-machine interface takes over. Potentially even removing the Link's warmup cycle and/or - potentially - negating the ADM effects on the target structure.

We'll see.
