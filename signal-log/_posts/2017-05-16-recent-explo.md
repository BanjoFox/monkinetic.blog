I've been sitting in a Class 2 Anoikis system, in no hurry to go anywhere special. Every so often I pop probes and check out any new sgnatures: might be an interesting connection or site. Today I found a new C3 connection, jumped through, and after bookmarking the exit (thanks *Allison*) I safed up and started scanning.

*Gas cloud, yawn*

*Wormhole...* Resolve the signature, bookmarked.

*Relic site...* Hm, could be interesting. Resolve the signature a bit... *Ruined Blood Raiders Temple*. Good! Haven't run across a pirate "archaeology" site in a few days. I finished resolving the sig and saved the location, and continued scanning.

*Relic site...* Ok, this is nice. Focus probes some... *Angel Crystal Quarry*. Excellent! Good chance of some nice loot there. Resolve, bookmark.

*Relic site...* *Blood Raider Temple*. It's a good day - I haven't had more than two sites in a wormhole in ages... this system must have had a series of good connections to low security space at some point in it's long history for several pirate factions to set up shop here. I save the location and start on the last signature of the day.

*Relic site...* If I was Amarr I'd be offering thanks to God for this hole. *Blood Raider Crystal Quarry*. **YES**. This could be an excellent day, assuming the ever-present cloaky Proteus (every relic hunter's boogeyman) doesn't decide to ruin it. Resolve the sig some more, save the location.

I warp to the single wormhole and after consulting the sensors, work out the connection tag and make a note that it's connecting to Null-security space. Not sure I'm interested in leaving Anoikis any time soon, so I won't be taking this connection, but I save the location just in case.

*Time to play...*
