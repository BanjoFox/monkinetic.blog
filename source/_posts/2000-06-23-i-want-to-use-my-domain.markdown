I really want to use my domain. I own http://www.redmonk.net/, but I don&#39;t have a place to host it that either 1) has &quot;Manila&quot;, or 2) is under my control so that I can do what I damn well please with it. Until I can find a hosting solution that meets those requirements, Redmonk stays here. 

http://www.redmonk.net/ is currently hosted wiith <a href="http://www.llamacom.com">Llamacom.com</a>, a small hosting setup somewhere in Iowa I think. It&#39;s cheap, and I can ftp stuff there. But since I started using &quot;Manila&quot;, I&#39;ve been spoiled. So all my effort goes here, instead of there.

Being a good web developer without my own server, is so... embarassing. *sigh*.

I think if I ever wrote a CMS, the combination of &quot;Frontier&quot;/&quot;Manila&quot; would be my inspiration and model. I hope &quot;Dave&quot; would see that as a compliment. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;

BTW, &quot;Dave&quot; is a <a href="http://www.scripting.com">prolific writer</a>. And I&#39;ve never been hooked on a website like I&#39;m hooked on &quot;Scripting News&quot;. Thanks, Dave.
