From Apple&#39;s OSX Public Beta - <a href="http://redmonk.net/wp-admin/">Extreme Internet</a> page:

&quot;We&#39;ve integrated WebDAV into Mac OS X in innovative ways, making it easy to access WebDAV servers from the Finder like any other file server and giving applications the ability to open and save documents to the web.&quot;

I love seeing Apple embracing all the right standards. And I still love seeing them <a href="http://www.apple.com/firewire/">creating ones</a>, too.
