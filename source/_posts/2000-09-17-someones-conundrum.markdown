<a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$21406">DW</a>, re: <a href="http://manila.userland.com/">Manila</a>: &quot;We use the tools, we&#39;re sick of how awful we are, but we also know that they&#39;re the best that are available anywhere. What a conundrum.&quot;

I&#39;ve been using <a href="http://www.free-conversant.com/">Conversant</a> for a week. I&#39;m sorry Dave, but <a href="http://www.macrobyteresources.com/conversant">Conversant</a> trumps Manila in every way except for <i>initial</i> ease-of-use. After a week I know where to find almost everything I need right now, and there&#39;s more power to be found when I&#39;m ready for it.
