I was just reminded that the Common Log format does not include domain-name reverse lookups. I am really out-of-touch with my servers. I haven&#39;t looked at a raw server log since leaving <a href="http://www.artlabeurope.com">Germany</a> in April &#39;98, when I used to read over our Free-BSD server&#39;s Apache logs. <i>Sigh</i>
