This is me, this weekend, in the garage. Notice, if you will, the Lava Java t-shirt, a gift from grateful coffe-house owners in Hawaii after I designed a new logo/packaging scheme for them for a design school project. (This shirt bears the previous logo. Full disclosure: they never used my work, after all.) 

This shirt is 7 years old, has survived several rock-climbing trips (during one of which it was used to protect a rope and &#39;biner), and is my most comfortable, most beloved t-shirt.
