XNS, or <a href="http://www.xns.org/xns/nutshell.html">eXtensible Naming Service</a>, is an XML+agent technology. Using XML is great, but XNS seems to have patented the agent technology (idea?) used with the XML. I think this will actually hinder the adoption of what seems to be an otherwise interesting idea. If we have to license XNS&#39;s agent patent in order to write compatible applications, then why use XML in the first place? I&#39;m going to watch this one.
