<a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave</a> has put the Userland <a href="http://discuss.userland.com">Discussion Group</a> on pause, and is <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/10/03#mailPages">re-instituting</a> the &quot;Mail Pages&quot;, which ran &#39;96..&#39;98. To help ease the time burden is <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio Userland</a>, Dave&#39;s &uumlaut;ber-content-tool.

This is a good thing... I remember reading the mail pages with a sense that the people writing Dave were <i>thinking</i>, that they knew that one has a right to speak, but not a right to have someone listen. If you were listened to, it was because you had something to say that Dave thought was interesting, useful, or beautiful. And it was understood that Dave&#39;s opinion in this forum was the one that mattered. You don&#39;t like it, find another forum.
