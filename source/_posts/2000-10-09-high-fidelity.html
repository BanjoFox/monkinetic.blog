Watching <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0146882">High Fidelity</a> today. I love John Cusack - intelligent, funny, occasionally depressing. Interesting mumble.

Cusack (or his director?) makes use of the Shakespearian (did he start it?) mechanism of soliloquy (talking to the audience). Also used extensively in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0119229">Grosse Point Blank</a>, the story of a contract killer and his high school reunion.
