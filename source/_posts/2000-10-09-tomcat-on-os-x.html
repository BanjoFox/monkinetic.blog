<a href="http://www.osxfaq.com/">OS-X FAQ</a> has a pointer to <a href="http://www.jspformacs.com/articles/howto_tomcat.html">a great article</a> on how to get Tomcat (the reference implementation for the 1.2 JSP/Servlet spec) running under &quot;Mac OS X&quot;.

As we are doing a lot of servlet development rightnow, this is great news. The article comes with two version s of the instructions - the 15 step GUI (newbie) version, and the 4 step command-line version (wget, gnutar, cd, startup.sh).  <i>I love having a &quot;real&quot; command line again.</i>
