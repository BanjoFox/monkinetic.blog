I&#39;m using Eric Peyton&#39;s excellent <a href="http://www.epicware.com/fire.html">Fire.app</a> to chat with my AIM buddies, who kept telling me that I was boucing on and off the network. I contacted Eric, who replied:

<i>It seems that AOL doesn&#39;t really like Fire.app :)  They are bouncing
people.  I am trying to figure it out.

Eric</i>

So- if anyone else out there is Using Fire.app and are experiencing the same things, there&#39;s your answer. Hopefully Eric will be sucessful - good luck, Eric!
