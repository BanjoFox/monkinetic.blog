<a href="http://www.free-conversant.com/free-conversant/support/1614">David Carter-Tod asks</a> a newbie question on the <a href="http://www.free-conversant.com/support/">Conversant support site</a>, and recieves a plethora of responses.

I have really enjoyed becoming a part of the Conversant user community, as they are one of the most helpful and congenial communicties I have been involved in. <a href="http://www.macrobyte.net">Macrobyte</a> is extremely focused on delivering a great product, listens to it&#39;s customers attentively, and are delivering in a big way.
