<b>Just In Time</b>

OK, so I finish up the &quot;How-To: RSS in Conversant&quot; just in time for &quot;Macrobyte&quot;, bless their souls, to release the <a href="http://www.free-conversant.com/free-conversant/support/docs/Pages/advQueryPage">Advanced Search Page</a>, which solved the problems I had with the normal Query Page.

To get up to speed, make sure you&#39;ve <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/stories/howToRss">read the first How-To</a>. You don&#39;t have to do it all, just be familiar with the ideas.

<b>Advanced Queries</b>

Now, on to doing it &quot;right&quot;, using the <a href="http://www.free-conversant.com/free-conversant/support/docs/Pages/advQueryPage">Advanced Query Page</a> as the basis for our RSS feed. The two features that the Advanced Query Page gives us is 1) some great new <a href="http://www.free-conversant.com/free-conversant/support/docs/Pages/advQueryPageDates">date specifications</a>, and 2) the ability to kill the query form and load the query automatically when the page loads. There&#39;s an example of the page we&#39;re building <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/xml/recentRedmonk_091.rss">here</a>. This version uses the same version of RSS as the first tutorial, version 0.91. I&#39;ve also created a <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/xml/recentRedmonk_10.rss/">version</a> that implements RSS 1.0.

First we&#39;re going to set up the Advanced Query Page.
