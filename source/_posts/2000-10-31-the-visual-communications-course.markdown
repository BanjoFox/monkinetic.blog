<a href="http://www.artlabeurope.com/vcc/index.html">This course</a> is one I&#39;ve always wanted to take. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t have the opportunity when I was in Germany. Maybe someday.

The Visual Communications Course was developed by Joseph Avakian, my art director from <a href="http://www.artlabeurope.com/">a previous life</a> and an excellent communicator. His multi-lingual, multi-cultural background, visual expertise, and abundance of patience make him one of the best designers I&#39;ve had the privilege of knowing.
