On <a href="http://inessential.com/">inessential.com</a>, the <a href="http://inessential.com/2000/11/13.html">light goes on</a> for Brent as he configures &quot;Mac OS X&quot; as a &quot;Frontier&quot; server:

&quot;The beauty of OS X is that Apache&#39;s already there. You can give your machine two IP addresses: Frontier listens on one; Apache listens on the other.&quot;

Finally, a Mac OS that gets some respect.

&quot;Frontier. Apache. Two great tastes that taste great together -- <i>on the same damn box, thank ye very much</i>.&quot;
