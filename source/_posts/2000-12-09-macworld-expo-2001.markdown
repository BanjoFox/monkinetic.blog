Welcome to &quot;Redmonk.Net&quot;&#39;s subsite for MacWorld Expo 2001!

Jodi and I decided today to head out to the MacWorld Expo in San Fransisco, January 9 - 12 at the Moscone Center.

This site will have a real home page soon, and a new template, and all kinds of other goodies. Maybe I&#39;ll post MacWorld rumors, maybe I&#39;ll start another weblog. Hey - now there&#39;s an idea.
