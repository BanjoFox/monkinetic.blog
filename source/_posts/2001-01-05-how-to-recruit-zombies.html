&quot;While walking through Davis Square today, I tried to recruit members for my army of zombies. 

In order to identify myself to potential zombies, I walked with stiff legs and arms thrust out in front of me. I repeated the only zombie word I know -- &#39;nnnnnhhhh&#39; -- and ambled around the brick plaza in the center of the square. The message was clear: &quot;Zombies, unite around me and we shall crush the living! Their tender brains shall be our sustenance! Nnnnnhhh!&quot;

While I found no willing recruits, I did discover one striking thing: pigeons are scared shitless of zombies.&quot;
