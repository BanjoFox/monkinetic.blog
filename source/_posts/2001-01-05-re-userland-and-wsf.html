&quot;The only reason they&#39;d bring it back is if they&#39;re running Manila behind IIS or some other server, on that machine.&quot;

I don&#39;t know why, since they&#39;re undoubtedly running Radio Userland as the local server... perhaps it&#39;s so users can also have IIS or Personal Webserver running at the same time? Strange.
