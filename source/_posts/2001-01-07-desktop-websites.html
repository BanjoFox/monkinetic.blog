A <a href="http://brian.carnell.com/539">discussion</a> on the virtues of the <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2001/01/04/desktopWebsites">Desktop Website</a> has begun over at Brian Carnell&#39;s site. 

My take: it works, but native apps are going to be faster, more reliable, and better integrated into the user&#39;s experience.
