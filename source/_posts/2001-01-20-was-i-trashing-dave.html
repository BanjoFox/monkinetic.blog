I know that very few people read this site, but for those who do, I have a question. Today on <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/01/19">Scripting News</a> Dave says:

&quot;I was browsing around the Web last night ... and came across a couple of sites that were trashing me on a personal level for my opinions about Mac OS X&quot;

Now I only know of two sites that even responded to Dave&#39;s
comments - this site was one of them. Now I had to respond, since there are a lot of Mac users who read Dave, and the last thing we need is more <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/FUD.html">FUD</a> about what Apple did, is doing, or should have done. I made a point of not attacking Dave - he&#39;s not stupid, or anything like that, but I disagree wholeheartedly with his analysis of the situation. So I took <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/01/17">his comments</a> (after the Cringley link) and <a href="http://redmonk.net/archives/2001/01/17/wrong-choice-ibzzzti/">responded</a>.

So - if you are a reader of this site, I&#39;d like to know what <i>you</i> think. Read Dave&#39;s comments, read mine - was I trashing Dave?
