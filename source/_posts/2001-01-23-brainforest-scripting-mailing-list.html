In the absolute dirth of web resources for scripting Aportis Technologies&#39; <a href="http://www.aportis.com/products/BrainForest/benefits.html">BrainForest</a>, I&#39;ve started <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/brainforest-scripting">brainforest-scripting</a>, a new mailing list for people interested in using AppleScript (or other OSA-compatible language) and Brainforest.

I&#39;m doing this because Aportis provides no customer support for scripting BrainForest.
