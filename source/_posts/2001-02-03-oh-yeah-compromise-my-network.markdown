<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/02/02">Dave writes</a>: &quot;Prediction. Look for users sneaking DSL lines into offices much as they snuck in Apple IIs in the early 80s. From there it&#39;s a simple matter of setting up departmental LANs that are fully part of the Internet and unencumbered by system managers and firewalls.&quot;

I&#39;m sorry - firewalls may be a little problem for Dave&#39;s <a href="http://www.thetwowayweb.com/desktopwebsites">next big thing</a>- but they are put there for a reason, to protect the corporate network from those who would compromise it.  There&#39;s a reason that network admins freak when you hook a phone line to the modem in your desktop machine - that&#39;s an open door past the firewall. 

Solving the problem of getting content from my machine to the world is going to take better software, not sieve-like networks.
