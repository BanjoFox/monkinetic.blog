Heard on NPR this morning: 

After it was discovered by our northern neighbors that <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">GWB</a> had a meeting with new Mexican President Vicente Fox planned - <i>before</i> meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, a bout of national insecurity and a flurry of phone calls ensued. As a result, the Canadian PM will be meeting GWB for a &quot;making your acquaintance&quot; meeting in the near future, 11 days before the aforementioned meeting in Mexico.

I&#39;ll never grok politics.

(I&#39;ll hear from &quot;Jim&quot; on this one shortly, I&#39;m sure.)
