Well, after probably a year of using <a http://www.weblogs.com"="http://www.weblogs.com&quot;">Weblogs.Com</a> as my jumping-off point, I need to get some new blood in my list of daily reads. 
I <i>have</i> started browsing the non-favorite blogs, looking for gems; I recently added <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/coming.html">Zeldman</a>, for example, but mostly I&#39;ve lost interest in most of my daily grind.

I need new blood. Daily is best, meaty is a serious bonus. Better than this site is a requirement.

Feed Me, Seymour!
