<a href="http://www.cofax.org/default.htm">Cofax.CMS</a> is a content management system written in Java. It&#39;s open source, for those who care (of which I&#39;m one), and was developed by (or in cooperation with?) Knight-Ridder publishing. Looks fairly full-featured and extensible.

<a href="http://www.scripting.com">Dave</a> says Dan Gillmor is moving his weblog to software created by  K-R. I&#39;m assuming that means Cofax. Cool.
