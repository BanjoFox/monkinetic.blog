What hype is being broken through here? Definitely not the hype surrounding some Open Source software. perhaps if the article had been called &quot;Breaking Through The FUD&quot; it would have been more acurately titled - this is an apology for the LAMP (Linux-Apache-PHPPerl) crowd. 

As I wrote while chatting with <a href="http://web.webwerks.co.nz">Andrew Duncan</a> this evening: &quot;when was the last time you saw an article by some open source developer that said - &#39;gee, this commercial product really beats the pants off our open source one.&#39;&quot;
