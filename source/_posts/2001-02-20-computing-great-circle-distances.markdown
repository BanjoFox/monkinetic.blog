Chatting with <a href="http://web.webwerks.co.nz/">Andrew Duncan</a> last night we got onto the topic of great circle distances - the shortest distance between two points on the Earth&#39;s surface. (A practical application for the shortest distance between two points on the surface of any sphere)

Looks like Andrew <a href="http://web.webwerks.co.nz/content/greatcircle/distanceformula">found the formula</a>. Way to go, mate!

&quot;The great circle path is the intersection of a spherical surface with a plane passing through the two points on the surface and the center of the sphere.&quot;
