From the <a href="http://cms.filsa.net/archives/cms-list/">CMS LIst</a>: <a href="http://cmf.zope.org/PTK/Members/jshell/PortalDesigns.txt">This article</a> by one of <a href="http://www.digicool.com/">Digital Creations</a>&#39; staff highlights some of the common types of portal sites and their content management needs. Focused on <a href="http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a>&#39;s <a href="http://cmf.zope.org/">CMF</a>, but can easily be abstracted on-the-fly to CMSes in general.
