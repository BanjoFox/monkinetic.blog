Dave <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/03/08">writes</a>:<br />
&quot;One developer who plans to attend the meeting.. said Microsoft is looking to extend the capabilities of IM as a standalone application and turn it into a software infrastructure that can be used to build many types of applications.&quot; <i>Gotta get some of that</i>

Dave, that&#39;s what <a href="http://www.jabber.com/technology/index.shtml">Jabber</a> <a href="http://www.jabber.org">is</a>. You keep asking &quot;what is Jabber?&quot; - well, <a href="http://www.osopinion.com/Opinions/EliotLandrum-ThomasCharron/Eliot-Thomas1.html">there you go</a>.
