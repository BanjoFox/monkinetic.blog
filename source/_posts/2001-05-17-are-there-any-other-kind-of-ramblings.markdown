Whew. It&#39;s been a while, but there are times you just have to write. I just read <a href="http://www.edge.org/documents/adams_index.html">this lament</a> by Richard Dawkins over Douglas Adams&#39; death. Sad, poignant, funny. Reminders that Douglas Adams spoke and lived the same way he wrote. &quot;...The depression uncannily being exactly the same shape as the puddle.&quot; <p>

I own all five books in the <i>Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy</i> trilogy, and have read both <i>Dirk Gently</i> novels... god, I&#39;m going to miss you, Mr. Adams.</p>
