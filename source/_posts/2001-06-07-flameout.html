I&#39;m not an inveterate flamer. In fact, I rarely even post on most of the mailing lists I subscribe to. But today <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/mailman/archive/webobjects-talk/2001-June/001286.html">this post</a> on Omni&#39;s WOTalk list just left me steaming. I jumped in while the iron was hot and banged out <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/mailman/archive/webobjects-talk/2001-June/001287.html">this response</a>.<p>

&quot;Oh, brother, will you people please SHUT UP?&quot;</p>
