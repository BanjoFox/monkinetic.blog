A week ago, after months of working on smoke-and-mirrors demos of our current project, we were allowed to actually go to work on a functional spike of the process - an end-to-end prototype. Yesterday we got it running. Browser to web app server to application to back-end, encompassing two different operating systems and at least four tiers.<p>

I mean, it ain&#39;t rocket science, but geez it was nice to have accomplished something.</p>
