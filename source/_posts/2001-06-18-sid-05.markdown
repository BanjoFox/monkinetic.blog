Sid 0.5 has been released for download <a href="http://media.redmonk.net/software/SidDist.dmg.gz">here</a>. Coolest new feature: Labels. Sid can download and save a list of your conversation&#39;s labels, allowing you to set the label for a message in Sid, rather than having to edit it again in the browser to set the label.
