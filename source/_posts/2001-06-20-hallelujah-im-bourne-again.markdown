Some <a href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/bash/html_node/bashref_toc.html">light reading</a> today. I&#39;m working on a set of build scripts that rely on the behavior of bash; running them in my previous favorite shell - tcsh - produced less-than-desirable results. So, I found bash for OS X <a href="http://www.geocities.co.jp/SiliconValley-Oakland/2986/macosx/pkgs.html">here</a> and installed it.
