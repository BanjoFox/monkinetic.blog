<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/general%40jakarta.apache.org/msg01471.html">Jason Van Zyl</a>: &quot;I would like to propose the movement of the Helma XML-RCP package (http://xmlrpc.helma.org/) to Jakarta.&quot;<p>

This would be really cool. Hannes has put in a lot of effort and time into his XML-RPC package for Java, and I know that it is use extensively, including in software our company is working on. This woule be really cool to see happen.</p>
