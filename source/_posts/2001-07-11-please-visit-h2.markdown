I&#39;m trying to convince my co-worker Hans to update his site, <a href="http://www.codefoo.org/~hans/">H2</a>. He says he doesn&#39;t get enough traffic to justify the effort, so it&#39;s up to all of you out there to <a href="http://www.codefoo.org/~hans/">visit him</a>.<p>

Hans wrote his own weblog software in PHP/MySQL. He&#39;s planning on releasing it at some point, so <a href="mailto:hrhabe@yahoo.com">mail him</a> if you want a look.</p>
