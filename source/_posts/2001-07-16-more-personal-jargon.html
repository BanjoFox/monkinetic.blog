<a href="http://www.torsion.org/wittenspeak/">Wittenspeak</a>: <p>&quot;OPP n.<p>
Other People&#39;s Perl, which is generally unreadable and thus should be avoided at all costs. Example: &quot;I&#39;m not down with OPP.&quot;<p>
Recent personal example: trying to understand the inner werkings of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/bugzilla/">Bugzilla</a>.</p></p></p>
