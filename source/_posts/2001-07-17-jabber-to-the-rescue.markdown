<a href="http://www.jabber.org">Jabber</a> is rocking our office world right now. We downloaded the server, and got one up and running (in short order really) on a local Linux box.<p>

The reason is this: we have taken to doing a lot of dev chat in house, and were using <a href="http://www.aol.com/aim">AIM</a>. We decided that we did not want sensitive information going out (unencrypted even) over AIM&#39;s network.<p>

Now, do you suppose AOL is giving away their server code so you or I can run an AIM server? &lt;AHEM&gt; No. <p>

With Jabber, however, we get mostly all the features of AIM, in an open server we can run in-house. It&#39;s got IM, and group chatting, so we can use it for sub-teams to hang out and communicate. Yay!</p></p></p>
