Hey webreaderz! I&#39;m back from a much-needed vacation, road-tripping across the eastern US up to Niagara Falls, Toronto, and points north. Canada rules, the people are great, and the Canadian side of the Falls just kicks pants off the American side.<p>

Jodi and I took about 45 minutes of video footage, and 50 or so digital pics. Hopefully soon we&#39;ll get them edited into a series of road-trip vignettes, available for download here on Redmonk.Net.</p>
