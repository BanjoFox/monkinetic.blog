Great post on some mailing list: <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001JulSep/0699.html">In Defense Of Flame Wars</a>. The author makes some really good points about the nature of public debate and communication in a textual, non-real-time medium. There are some web boards I&#39;ve frequented that could benefit from some of this.
