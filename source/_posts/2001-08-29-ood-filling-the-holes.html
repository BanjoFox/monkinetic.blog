I&#39;m in the middle of the first largish-scale OOD project I&#39;ve done. I&#39;m a newbie to formalized design (UML et al) so I&#39;m fascinated (and sometimes frustrated!) at the process.<p>

I have a definite feeling that the process is more important to UML&#39;s inventors than the end result, but that impression may change as we get into implementation. Hard to predict the benefit this process will bring to the end product - but I mark that up to inexperience.</p>
