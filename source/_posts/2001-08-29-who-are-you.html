I looked at my membership roll today... wow. There&#39;s some people joining this site. Cooooool. Hmmm - all I have is your email addresses. I am steve@redmonk.net. Who are you? Here&#39;s a random sampling of email addresses that have joined my site (if this bothers you please <a href="mailto:steve@redmonk.net">let me know</a>). I love seeing new members - email addresses are intriguing, seeing how people identify themselves in a form of limited communication...<p>

bert at minke.nu<p>

danewbie at yahoo.com<p>

dj_corky at hotmail.com<p>

fubardk at yahoo.com<p>

(a fav) sharkielaw at hotmail.com<p>

xi0n at freeze.com<p>

So - is your name here? Would you like to introduce yourself? You can do it <a href="/discuss">here</a> or <a href="mailto:steve@redmonk.net">here</a>. I&#39;d like to start a little series of intros, so let me know if I can post your intro (if you email it). Thanks!!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p>
