<a href="http://www.lindaspaces.com/news/news080601.html">This is so cool.</a><br />
&quot;The Piranha feature in Paradise brings easy to use Peer-to-Peer (P2P) computing to networks of Mac OS X machines. Piranha delivers performance and throughput gains by tapping into the huge reserves of computational power that is available on most networks. As new computational tasks come and go, Piranha automatically and transparently allocates computational resources to meet the changing demand.&quot;
