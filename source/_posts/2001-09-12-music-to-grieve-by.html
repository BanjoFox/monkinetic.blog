I&#39;ve started a WTC Mix... right now it includes: &quot;In The End&quot; and &quot;One Step Closer&quot; by Linkin Park, &quot;Dragula&quot; by Rob Zombie, &quot;Alive&quot; by POD, &quot;Leave You Far Behind&quot; by Lunatic Calm, &quot;The Winner&quot; by Crystal Method. Make it hurt. Make it loud.
