<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/international/AP-Israel-Palestinians.html">Israel and the Palestinians have called a truce</a>. Astonishingly, it was Yasser Arafat to step out with a unilateral cease-fire. Isreal quickly followed suit. I say astonishingly because while I am generally pro-Israel, the Palestinians have had NO reason recently to lay down arms.
