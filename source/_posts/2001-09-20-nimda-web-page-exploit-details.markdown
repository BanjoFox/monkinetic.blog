Ok, I found an infected site. (I notified the webmaster, who was already aware of the situation. The site is now down.) Anyway, here&#39;s the skinny:<p>

Nimda presumably uses IIS&#39;s ability to add footers to HTML documents. Once it infects a server running IIS, it appears to add two new lines to the default document (&quot;/&quot;, default.[asp,htm]), <i>after</i> the original &lt;html&gt;...&lt;/html&gt; element. Each line is another &lt;html&gt; tag, containing a single &lt;script tag. The tag opens a new window at coordinates 6000,6000 (way off the screen). The &quot;src&quot; attribute points to the virus file, &quot;readme.eml&quot;. If IE is reading the page, it will probably try to open the .eml file (a saved email from Outlook) in the default viewer - Outlook. Doing so will run the virus, and the host will now be infected. Naaaaaasty.</p>
