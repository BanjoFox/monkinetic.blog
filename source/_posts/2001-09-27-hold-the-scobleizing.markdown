I used to follow Robert Scoble&#39;s blog: <a href="http://scobleizer.manilasites.com/">Scobleizer</a> regularly, when he was a conference organizer and respectful M$ apologist. Since joining <a href="http://www.userland.com/">Userland</a> as Marketing guru, it seems like <a href="http://scobleizer.manilasites.com/2001/09/25">every</a> <a href="http://scobleizer.manilasites.com/2001/09/27">other</a> day is a Userland ad.<p>

Hey Scoble: I appreciate your enthusiasm for Manila, but give it a rest, ok?</p>
