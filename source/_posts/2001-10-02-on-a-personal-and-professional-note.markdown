Well, I can finally get this off my chest. After working with Compass for 3 years now, I&#39;ve taken a position with U-Haul in Phoenix, AZ. I&#39;m emotionally exhausted right now, after turning in my resignation today, and explaining it to my project manager, supervisor, and the somewhat flabbergasted HR department. <p>

The good news is: I&#39;ll be doing WebObjects development, with an awesome team of geeks, in the 2-story WebHouse in downtown Phoenix. I&#39;ll post more later, but right now I have to begin planning my exit from Planet Compass.</p>
