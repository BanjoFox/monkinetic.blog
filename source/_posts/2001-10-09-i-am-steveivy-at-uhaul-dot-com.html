Until making it out to Phoenix, I&#39;ve been set up with the <a href="http://www.centrinity.com/">First Class</a> client, so I can access U-Haul&#39;s email system and groupware environment. I&#39;ve never used First Class before, and I&#39;m pretty impressed with it so far. From what I hear it&#39;s been this good for 12 years. Soooooo, why is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/default.asp">Exchange</a> even on the radar?
