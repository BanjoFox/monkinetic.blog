I was just listening to <a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com">Rush Limbaugh</a> - something I hardly ever do anymore, since he&#39;s more of a blowhard now than ever... but I was in the car running errands earlier, and tuned in. It turns out Rush is going deaf, and has been for many months. He&#39;s wearing hearing aids now, and if his current medications do not help, he will probably be 100% deaf in a month or so.<p>

He&#39;s doing his show today more or less completely in silence, for him. He cannot hear callers, he cannot hear himself. His voice is a tad higher - more forced I think - but he is managing. He is likely going to continue his show (much to the Left&#39;s disappointment I suppose) but he is having to find ways to adapt. I think currently his callers are being transcribed in realtime for him, so he can follow along.<p>

Now, I know that Rush is one of those people that many folks either love or really really hate. But I have to admire someone who sticks with it the way he seems to be - even in a profession where being deaf would seem an insurmountable obstacle. I hope he finds his way, and can continue doing what he loves.<p>

BTW - I can&#39;t find any links online to confirm what I heard on the show, hopefully more details will come out later. I wonder if there&#39;s a service out there that does transcripts for radio shows that don&#39;t do their own?</p></p></p>
