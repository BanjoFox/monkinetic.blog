I&#39;ve spent the better part of today (and I do mean it was better ;-)) out in the soon-to-be-no-longer-mine garage, cleaning and packing and seperating the valuable shit from the ditritus. The valuable stuff get&#39;s either packed or put into the moving-sale pile. The ditritus goes into the Big Black Can. Rockin out to the radio (oh god for a portable MP3 player) and futzing around the garage. Heaven.
