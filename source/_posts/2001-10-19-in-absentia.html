This is Steve&#39;s wife, Jodi.  Just thought you all might like to know that Steve (and cats) are on the road to Arizona as of 4 am this morning.  But the adventure has evidently just begun.

I wrote about <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net">their first escapade (Herding Cats)</a>  on my site if you&#39;re interested: .

Upon arrival he will be receiving his Titanium Powerbook, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll all be hearing much about it. ;-)
