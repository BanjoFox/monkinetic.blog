<a href="http://blog.mattgoyer.com/2001/11/14.html#104407PM">Matt Goyer</a> says he could not work for U-Haul without going psycho...

He should have seen <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/webobjects-work/message/76">the job post</a> that got me my current position as a WebObjects programmer for U-Haul. You&#39;d be surprised what a two-story house full of awesome programmers and insane amounts of hardware can do for your state of mind.
