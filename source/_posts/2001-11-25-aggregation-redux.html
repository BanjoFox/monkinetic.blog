I&#39;m finally taking a day to hack on a project I&#39;ve been wanting to do for ages. Others <a href="http://my.userland.com">have built</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=RSS+news+aggregator">RSS news aggregators</a> before, and I don&#39;t suppose mine will be anything special, but I&#39;m digging deeper into WebObjects, and hope to implement some cool ideas in my own news aggregator.<p>

As usual, I&#39;m scratching my own itch here. Maybe someone else will find it works for them, too.</p>
