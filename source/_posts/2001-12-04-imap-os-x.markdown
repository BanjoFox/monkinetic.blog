Now that we have ubiquitous networking at home, and broadband access to the&#39;net, I&#39;m going to get an IMAP server set up on my home G3, so we don&#39;t have to POP our mail from multiple machines. <p>

Coincidently enough, <a href="">Stepwise</a> has a great <a href="http://www.stepwise.com/Articles/Workbench/eart.index.html">Workbench article</a> detailing how to set up an IMAP server on OS X.</p>
