Jim just released <a href="http://jim.roepcke.com/3493">an outline-based IM suite</a> for Userland&#39;s <a href="http://radio.userland.com">outliner</a>. Jim developed this back in January 2000... I *think* I had a chance to play with it - if the memory I&#39;m dredging up is accurate, it was pretty cool. ;-)
