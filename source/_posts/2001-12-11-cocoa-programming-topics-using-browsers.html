The &quot;column-view&quot; in Mac OS X, affectionately known to Cocoa geeks as an NSBrowser, is a really really awesome and efficient way of browsing hierarchies. I&#39;m working on an app (on and off) that needs an NSBrowser, so I&#39;m posting this link to the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Cocoa/TasksAndConcepts/ProgrammingTopics/Browser/index.html">Using Browsers</a> topic of the Cocoa Programming Topics documentation.
