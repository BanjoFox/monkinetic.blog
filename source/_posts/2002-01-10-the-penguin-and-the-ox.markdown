<a href="http://doc.weblogs.com">Doc</a> has a really cool <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=5715&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0">article</a> over on Linux Journal, reporting from MacWorld. BTW Doc, I think someone already has the Ox, I&#39;m not sure. (I can see it in my head, but for the life of me I can&#39;t remember where to look for it.)
