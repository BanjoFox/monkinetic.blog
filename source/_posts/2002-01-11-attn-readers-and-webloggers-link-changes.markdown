I&#39;ve changed the behavior of the links on the post titles on redmonk.net. Clicking the title will now take you to the thread page for that message, which I think is more useful (and prettier too). If you want to view just the message, or link to a post, use the &quot;Msg Link&quot; link just below the post.
