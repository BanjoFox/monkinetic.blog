Jim is mocking me... I just re-discovered <a href="http://www.dansanderson.com/blogtracker/">blogtracker</a>, n&eacute;e the SubHonker Filter. Dan has even has a <a href="http://www.dansanderson.com/blogtracker/spane.php?open=1">Mozilla sidebar</a> for it. Joy Joy! Now I can get all these pesky Weblogs out of my bookmarks.
