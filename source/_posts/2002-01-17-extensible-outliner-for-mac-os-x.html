You find the most interesting things on <a href="http://www.dansanderson.com/blogtracker/">BlogTracker</a>...<p>

<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/arboretum/">Arboretum</a> is going to be an extensible (plug-in style) outliner for Mac OS X. Looks like a nicer site is going up <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/arboretum/">here</a>.<p>

Unfortunately it looks like there&#39;s no code yet (in CVS at least), and nothing to download. :-(</p></p>
