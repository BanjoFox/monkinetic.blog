I have a quandry: Jodi and I have been invited to a friends house for dinner tonight with a bunch of other people (many of whom I&#39;m thinking we will not know). I think it might be fun to go, but I don&#39;t do extended social engagements as well as Jodi does. I&#39;m more inclined to <a href="http://redmonk.net/archives/2002/01/14/between-a-rock-and-a-soft-place/">go bouldering</a> at my favorite rock house. What to do?
