Through an interesting twist of link I ended up on the old <a href="http://www.scriptmeridian.org/">Script Meridian</a> website today. For old times sake I trawled throught <a href="http://www.scriptmeridian.org/doodads/">DOODADS</a>, and came across what is probably the last <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/">Frontier</a> script I ever released. <a href="http://www.scriptmeridian.org/doodads/LoadRegexedImages.html">Load Regexed Images</a> would let you give it a regex to apply to a folder of images, and load any image that matched the regex into Frontier&#39;s <a href="http://static.userland.com/frontierImages/davenetedit.gif">object database</a>. I was hacking Frontier a lot back then - <i>8/7/1998</i>. (<a href="http://redmonk.net/archives/2002/01/11/radio-userland-tools/3">Background</a>)
