Charles Wiltgen, (former?) Quicktime product manager, offers<a href="http://wiltgen.net/articles/dotnet/"> this .NET primer for Mac users</a>. Why .NET is going to affect us, and why it can be a Good Thing(tm).<p>
It&#39;s a good read, very basic, and he makes some very good points. I&#39;ll have to finish the article before passing judgement, but read it for yourself and see what <i>you</i> think.<p>
Best line: <i>It&#39;s the end of Windows as we know it, and I feel fine.</i></p></p>
