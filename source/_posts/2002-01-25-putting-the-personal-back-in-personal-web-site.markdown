Dave linked to my comment about IDL in non-typed scripting environments, which is cool. I know I&#39;ve gotten 50 or so hits from it. The link is appreciated - flow is nice. But I&#39;d also like to know what Dave thinks of my idea, since it&#39;s relevant to his work and that of others in the scripting community.<p>
I think sometimes we bloggers get on a roll, linking and blurbing, and it&#39;s easy to link to something in a very neutral &quot;here it is, I have no opinion&quot; manner. This is not a knock on Dave at all, it&#39;s something I do a good bit, and have seen many others do. <p>
Maybe we need to take stock, and put a little more effort to make sure the &quot;personal&quot; shows up in our &quot;personal web sites&quot;.</p></p>
