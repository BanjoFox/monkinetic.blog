From <a href="http://www.wired.com/">Wired</a>: A high-schooler has <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/gizmos/0,1452,49716,00.html">created a glove</a> that translates sign-language finger-spelling into text on a digital device via a wireless connection. That is awesome, and a real example of technology bettering the lives of the handicapped.
