Around 12:30 am last night I had to call Jodi in to the office. Looking pleadingly into her eyes, I said, &quot;Honey, I need an intervention. Get me away from the computer!&quot;<p>
We got our Cox connection back last night, and it spawned a bandwidth-induced site-tweaking and <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/2002/01/29">blogging frenzy</a>.<p>
I always hate myself the next morning...</p></p>
