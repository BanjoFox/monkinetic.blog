Got to have dinner last night with old-school Frontier guru, <a href="http://www.internet2.edu/activities/html/p2pworkshop.html">Peer-to-Peer speaker</a>, and all-around <a href="http://www.systemtoolbox.com/towelday/">hoopy frood</a> <a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/">Wes Felter</a>. We were headed to find some interesting night spot on Mill Avenue, near ASU, but we were both starving and settled for Chili&#39;s.<p>
A fun time was had, however, over an awesome blossom, quesadillas,  and a couple fine ales.</p>
