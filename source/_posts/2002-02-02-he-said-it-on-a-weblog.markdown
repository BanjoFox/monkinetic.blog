Dave <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/02/01#aNoteToCDevelopers">says</a>:&quot;When Sam Ruby talks about unwashed masses using IDEs, I know he doesn&#39;t get it. But get this, he said it on a weblog, in public, on the record. So he&#39;s on the path to enlightenment.&quot;<p>

So... having a weblog means that one day you will think like Dave Winer? <i>I don&#39;t think so</i>.</p>
