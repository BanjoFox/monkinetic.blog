<a href="http://www.appleturns.com/">As The Apple Turns</a> comments on <a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/wire/2001/12/07/school_computers/index.html?x">reports</a> that High Schoolers in Henrico County VA were caught using their new iBooks to download porn:<p>
&quot;if history has shown us anything, it&#39;s that if you give a teenager any technology more advanced than a rubber band and one of those little plastic things that holds the bread bag closed, said teenager, regardless of IQ or innate technical ability, will suddenly turn into <i>MacGyver</i> and find some way to use that technology to look at pictures of naked people.&quot;<p>
Sad but FUNNY.</p></p>
