Well, I am officially IM-less at work for the foreseeable future (and probably slightly beyond that). Our network guys are very security conscious and I don&#39;t fault them for it. The AIM protocol has been closed on the firewall.<p>
So, I&#39;m back to email, which in true internet fashion, seems so... <i>slow</i>. ;-)<p>
In the evenings from home, however, I&#39;ll be on AIM, and probably #p2p-hackers as well. <i>monkinetic</i> or <i>redmonk</i>.</p></p>
