My <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio Userland</a> stopped working today (free trial over). It was expected. Oh well. I was really enjoying using the outliner to post to my blog. But we&#39;re moving soon, and I don&#39;t have even the $40 to get a license to Radio.<p>

In tangentially related news, I&#39;m learning python. Maybe I&#39;ll write a python-redmonkinator.</p>
