I&#39;ve been reading about RDF in the evenings, and hanging out on #plex (irc.openprojects.net).<p>

<a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF">RDF</a> is big. Huge. I think I have an above-average ability to store information - I don&#39;t get overloaded too easily. But I&#39;m about to my limit on new stuff re: RDF and it&#39;s satellites.</p>
