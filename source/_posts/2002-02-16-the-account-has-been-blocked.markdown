Ugh. Jim wanted to report a bug in Userland&#39;s <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio Userland</a>, and ask a question. The <a href="http://jim.roepcke.com/2002/02/15#item4180">reward for his trouble</a>?<p>

<i>The account &lt;jim&#39;s email&gt; has been blocked from this service.</i><p>

Now Jim would be the first to admit he&#39;s had his differences with Dave, but he&#39;s always been constructive in his criticisms of their products, and he&#39;s been using Frontier (foundation of Radio Userland) for longer than many. Jim is also a paying Radio Userland customer. As Jim says: &quot;This is unacceptable.&quot;</p></p>
