<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/03/01#brentSimmons">Scripting News</a>: Brent Simmons is leaving Userland, for parts unknown. Thanks <a href="http://inessential.com/2002/03/01.html">Brent</a> for years of awesome software, and for being a great guy! (that part&#39;s not going to change. ;-)) Look forward to seeing you around the &#39;net!
