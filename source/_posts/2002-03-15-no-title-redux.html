I <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/2002/03/12#item1071">posted yesterday</a> a response to some comments by Doc Searls at SXSW. <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/1072">Jim responded</a>, which prompted me to respond again. I think my response was one of my better explanations of my political leanings, so I&#39;ve formalized it <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/stories/noTitle">here</a>. Seth also had <a href="http://www.truerwords.net/1785">some comments</a> worth checking out.<p>

For the time being it remains <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/stories/noTitle">No Title</a>, as I have no label for my own brand of neo-conservatism.</p>
