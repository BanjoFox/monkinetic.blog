Andrew Grove <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/14/technology/14PROT.html">responds to Hollywood</a>:
<blockquote>&quot;Is it the responsibility of the world at large to protect an industry whose business model is facing a strategic challenge?&quot; [...] &quot;Or is it up to the entertainment industry to adapt to a new technical reality and a new set of consumers who want to take advantage of it?&quot;</blockquote>

Preach it brother. Remember, <a href="http://www.mpaa.org/jack/2002/2002_02_12a.htm">Jack Valenti</a>: <i>The customer is always right</i>.

Peter Chernin of News Corp (same link):
<blockquote>&quot;We may be stupid but we&#39;re not idiotic. We&#39;re not going to offer ways for people to go and loot our content.&quot;</blockquote>

So don&#39;t. Take your content and go home, and watch it be replaced overnight. Let&#39;s see how fast you go down. You know what, Peter? I got my own news corp <b><a href="http://www.weblogs.com">right here</a></b>.
