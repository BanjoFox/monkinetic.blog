So... lots going on lately, haven&#39;t blogged a bit if it. What&#39;s interesting? Userland and others have been building a new weblog API (xml-rpc and soap), and Userland released a new driver-based architecture for Radio Userland. Sounds interesting, but I don&#39;t have RU, and my organization is too invested in First Class to look at other information distribution solutions. 

For now this paragraph is linkless - don&#39;t hate me, it will do you good to look it all up. -)
