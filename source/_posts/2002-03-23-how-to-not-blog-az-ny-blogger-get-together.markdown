I&#39;ve been up to my ears recently trying to get an app out the door for my employer. This has adversely affected my blogging frequency. I&#39;ll try and do better. -)

<a href="http://www.mrbarrett.com">Damien</a> is going to be in my neck of the woods April 5 - he and I and hopefully some other <a href="http://www.120degrees.com">AZ</a> <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/iblog/">bloggers</a> are going to have an AZ-NY blogger get-together. I feel so &quot;in&quot;.
