I totally ripped the title off from some other blog, or movie. Anyway, my life has been too dominated by work, and a few other things, to post lately. But here I am.

Our <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/2002/03/22#item1090">AZNY blogmeet</a> has expanded once again! Welcome to Angie, hostess of the very blue <a href="http://geocities.com/blueshoemanny/">blue shoe diaries</a>. Now Jodi and Kim (wife of <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/iblog/">Mark</a>) won&#39;t be the only gals. Yay!

I&#39;m really stoked about this. Yesterday I was about to hang up my blog for a while, but today I feel re-energized and ready to post! Of course
