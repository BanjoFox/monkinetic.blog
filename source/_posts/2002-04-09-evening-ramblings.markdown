Boy my brain is tired. I&#39;ve spent most of today trying to comprehend the Charlie Foxtrot that is my company&#39;s main database. The business rules involved are insanely complex, and are giving my a Grade-A headache. <i>Oy</i>.

On another note, Mark has <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/iblog/aznybbq.html">put up</a> his pics from the BBQ. Cool.
