>As the volume of blogs has ballooned well into six-figures, the need for links from "star" blogs has become an absolute requirement to be noticed.

Many bloggers I know, including myself, started before "blogging" *was*, and did so for the joy of having a voice, NOT because they got noticed. I would probably keep doing this even if no one ever read it. (Heck, practically no one does now!)
