Morning notes... Got the first cuppa coffee, soon everything will be juuuuusst fiiiiine.

In other news, Jim mentions the Canadian soldiers <a href="http://www.canoe.ca/CNEWSAttack0204/18_cdntroops-cp.html">that got bombed</a> by a US F-16 pilot with an itchy trigger finger. This is so sad. My heart goes out to the families of the dead and injured. 

It&#39;s going to be hard for the Gov&#39;mint to build coalitions if we keep dropping bombs on our allies&#39; heads.
