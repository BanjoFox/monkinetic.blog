Yay! I managed to get <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/software/Sid">Sid</a>, my <a href="http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/index.html">Cocoa</a>-based Conversant posting utility compiled again. I lost some of the more recent work on it, but I&#39;ve since changed the way I categorize posts, so the missing functionality is not missed.
