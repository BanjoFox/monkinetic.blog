Mark Pilgrim describes his own, and my, gardening abilities:
<blockquote>My aptitude with plants can only be described in the negative. Take all the qualities of a good gardener, and negate them, and that&#39;s me. ... I have telepathic powers that can kill plants just by looking at them. I can burn out a lawn in a hurricane. I am the opposite of a &quot;green thumb&quot;.</blockquote>
