My parents, Jodi, and I went north to Sedona yesterday. We hiked up to <a href="http://media.redmonk.net/collections/sedona/Pages/Image10.html">Cathedral Rock</a>, a breathtakingly beautiful formation with a view for miles and miles. It was about a .7 mile hike, with a rise of about 600 feet. 

At 4000&#39; elevation though, it was a lot more work than it sounds!
