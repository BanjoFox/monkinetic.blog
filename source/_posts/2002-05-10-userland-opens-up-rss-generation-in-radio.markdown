Dave <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/05/09#aSmallChange">writes</a>:
<blockquote>&quot;Yesterday we released a change to this core routine that allows the user to completely replace writeRssFile in an update-safe way.&quot;</blockquote>
Maybe we&#39;ll begin to see Radio users providing <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/files/specification.html">RSS 1.0</a>-compatible feeds now.
