Jodi&#39;s parents and I went to South Mountain last night, to see the sunset and the city lights. I&#39;ve mentioned it before - the sunsets out here are a thing to behold. 

Unfortunately we got a late start, so the sun had just set when we got there. Nevertheless, the view of the city lights was, as always, spectacular. And we did actually get to see a great moon-rise; the contrast between the huge, bright moon on one side, the brilliant lights of the cit on the other, and the darkness of the unlit park mountain park in between was amazing.
