<a href="http://diveintomark.org/">Mark Pilgrim</a> is happily hacking away on interesting uses for the HTML &lt;link&gt; tags a lot of bloggers have been putting up lately.

This time it&#39;s a <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/06/04.html">weblog neighborhood script</a> that uses the <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/">Google API</a> to ask Google what the &quot;related sites&quot; are for your site, then checks those sites for a blogroll (or other list of links). 

This shows you &quot;what sites are those people running sites like mine reading?&quot; Clear as mud? Well, check it out anyway, it&#39;s interesting. -)
