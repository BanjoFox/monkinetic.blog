I need to find a library for creating charts (report style) in Java. Ideally it should be:

<li>Freely available (open source or not, I don&#39;t care)</li>
<li>Be pure java but not depend on Swing or a windowing toolkit.</li>

This is to be used in a server environment to generate charts to be included in webbased reports.
