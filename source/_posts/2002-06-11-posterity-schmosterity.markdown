John Robb thinks that k-logs (fancy word for weblogs) in the corporate environment are a good thing becuase they are <a href="http://jrobb.userland.com/2002/06/07.html#a1933">archived for posterity</a>.

While I think this a good thing for small businesses, ask Enron if they want all an employee&#39;s important communiques archived and available for subpoena, er, retrieval.

This is one reason convincing large corporations (with a dread of liability) to adopt weblogs into their corporate cultures is going to be an uphill battle.
