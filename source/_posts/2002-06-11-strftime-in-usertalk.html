Seth Dillingham released a cool Conversant macro today, an <a href="http://support.free-conversant.com/docs/dates">implementation</a> of the unix <a href="http://www.neosoft.com/neosoft/man/strftime.3.html">strftime</a> function that is used with formatting dates. It works with several data/time related message macros, and date custom fields.

This is so totally amazingly cool. Way to go Seth!
