The &quot;Rodeo&quot; and &quot;Chedeski&quot; fires in north eastern Arizona have now eaten through <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/0623rimfire24-ON.html">300,000 acres of high country forest</a>.
 <blockquote>The fire has burned about 300,000 acres - about 479 square miles - since Tuesday. As many as 25,000 people have fled homes from more than half a dozen towns.</blockquote>
