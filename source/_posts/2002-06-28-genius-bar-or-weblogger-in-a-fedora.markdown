David McCusker had a <a href="http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/newJun02.htm#26jun02-bar">crappy experience</a> with the &quot;Geniuses&quot; at this local Apple Store&#39;s Genius Bar. 

He also got better service once he mentioned he would review the experience on his <a href="http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/new.htm">website</a>. Maybe we all should stick &quot;Weblogger&quot; badges in our fedoras when dealing with Apple?
