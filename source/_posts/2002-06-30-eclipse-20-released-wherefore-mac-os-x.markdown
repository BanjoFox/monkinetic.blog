Eclipse 2.0 has been released. <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> is a Meta-IDE, an integrated development environment for programmers that can be configured to work with most any language/runtime. You can download 2.0 <a href="http://64.38.198.171/downloads/">here</a>, but I&#39;m wondering what would need to be done to get a copy running on Mac OS X. There are Win32 and native X Windows versions... but it seems there&#39;s no (at elast) Pure Java version.
