From an <a href="http://boardserver.mycomputer.com/read.html?collapse=1&amp;uid=2032765&amp;u=dsable&amp;id=3672&amp;thread=3669&amp;f=1&amp;u=dsable">infertility board</a> I came across (the web is funny like that) (The question is about alcohol affecting infertility treatments, the doctor&#39;s response is below):

<blockquote>Hi Andi,<p>

If alcohol prevented pregnancy there would be no French people. I would keep it light however.<p>

David Sable MD</p></p></blockquote>
