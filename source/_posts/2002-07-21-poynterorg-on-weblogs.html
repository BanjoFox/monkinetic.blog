[via Jim] Poynter.org has <a href="http://www.poynter.org/centerpiece/weblogs/weblogs.htm">an 
article</a> about different kinds of weblogs and the uses they can be 
put to in the corporate or news world.

I had a thought about weblogs and newspapers. Newspapers could host 
weblogs, then run an (at least) internal aggregator. Make it easy for 
users to blog articles from the newspaper, then let editors use the 
aggregator to find content for the editorial page.
