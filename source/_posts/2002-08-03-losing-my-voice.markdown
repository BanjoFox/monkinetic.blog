I almost posted something earlier today titled &quot;All blogged out&quot;. Sometimes I think I lose my &quot;voice&quot;, lose track of why I blog. And just as I&#39;m about to write my farewell post, something in my head clicks, and I think &quot;oh, I&#39;ve got to blog that...&quot;

Heh. Guess I&#39;m not done <i>quite</i> yet!
