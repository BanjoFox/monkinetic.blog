Jim tells me he&#39;s been talking about flat taxes for years on HBWT, and pointed me to <a href="http://fairtax.org/">fairtax.org</a>. BTW - the &quot;Fair Tax&quot; they support is not an income tax, but a sales tax (<a href="http://www.fairtaxvolunteer.org/smart/sketch.html">overview here</a>). Meaning it&#39;s very transparent  - you know what you&#39;re paying and when. An interesting approach.

Here&#39;s a <a href="http://www.fairtaxvolunteer.org/materials/comparison.html">comparison</a> of the different tax schemes (current, flat, and FairTax).
