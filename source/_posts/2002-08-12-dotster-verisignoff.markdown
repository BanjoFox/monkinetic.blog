I recently moved the domain registration for redmonk.net from <a href="http://www.verisign.com">Verisign</a> to <a href="http://www.dotster.com">Dotster</a>. They&#39;re running a $8.95 domain transfer special through August 31, and they&#39;re a great registrar.

<a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com">Merlin Mann</a> runs a great site called <a href="http://www.verisignoff.com">VerisignOff</a> that provides tips on how to move your domain from Verisign to another cheaper, more customer friendly, less evil registrar. 
Merlin mentioned Dotster&#39;s special on VerisignOff, so I responded with a review of my experience with them. <a href="http://www.verisignoff.org/article.php?story=20020807235151594#comments">Check it out</a>.
