Mark Pilgrim was <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/08/13.html#ultraliberal_rss_parser">looking for a liberal RSS Parser</a> for Python, I&#39;m now looking for a liberal parser for Java. By liberal I mean that it can handle a large number of types of <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> files as input without borking. It does not mean a parser that cannot handle <a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/">Rush Limbaugh</a> without borking.
