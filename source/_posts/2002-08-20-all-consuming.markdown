This is most cool: <a href="http://www.allconsuming.net/">AllConsuming.net</a> is crawling the list of updated blogs (according to <a href="http://www.weblogs.com">weblogs.com</a>) and sucks out links to Amazon.com books. It then shows what blogs are linking to what books - a quick and easy way to find new books and what bloggers think of them.

Oh, <a href="http://www.blogcritic.com">blogcritic</a> should hook up with these guys...
