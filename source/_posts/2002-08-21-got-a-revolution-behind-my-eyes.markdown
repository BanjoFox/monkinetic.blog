<a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/">Lawrence Lessig</a> was <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/archives/2002_08.shtml#000385">looking for a theme song</a> for the copyright reform movement:
<blockquote>Got a revolution behind my eyes<br />
We got to get up and organize<br />
You want a revolution behind your eyes<br />
We got to get up and organize</blockquote>
