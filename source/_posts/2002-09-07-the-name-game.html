Mark Pilgrim has posted a (exhaustive as far as I can tell) <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/09/06.html#history_of_the_rss_fork">history</a> of the battle over <acronym title="[something] [something] [something]">RSS</acronym>. 

This name thing has given a bunch of people wedgies. I propose that the RDF guys give up, let <acronym title="Dave Winer">DW</acronym> gloat, and call the 1.0 spec <acronym title="RDF Syndication">RSYN</acronym> (pronounced &#39;arson&#39;).

Geez folks. Someone let go already. Is it <i>this</i> important?
