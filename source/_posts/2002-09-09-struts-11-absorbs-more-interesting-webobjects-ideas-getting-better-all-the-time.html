Struts 1.1 has gone beta, and has added (<a href="http://www.theserverside.com/resources/article.jsp?l=Struts1_1">among other cool stuff</a>) even easier form handling and automatic pushing/pulling of values into and out of the form. This is one of WebObjects&#39; strengths, and it&#39;s good to see it appearing in the open-source community.
