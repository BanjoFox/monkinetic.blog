I just sent this to Apple via their <a href="http://www.apple.com/feedback/ical.html">iCal feedback page</a>:
<blockquote>&quot;I think it would be very useful to allow HTML in the DESCRIPTION and SUBJECT fields, so that hyperlinks and formatting can be included. This would enhance the workflow of shared calendars - users can create an event, then point (in the description or subject) to a web-based resource.&quot;</blockquote>
