A <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/cs_msg/9620">comment</a> to Morbus&#39;s O&#39;Reilly post reveals how to get clickable urls. Put the url between angle brackets (&lt; &gt;).

UPDATE: It only seems to work in the subject of an event, and only really in a view like the daily or weekly, where you must double-click on the link to get it to open in your browser.
