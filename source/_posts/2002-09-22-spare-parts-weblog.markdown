I&#39;ve started a new weblog on this site for posts relating to software I&#39;m developing, starting with Sid. I have another project in the works that I&#39;m not ready to announce yet, but when I do it too will be discussed.

The <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/spareparts">spare parts weblog</a> is mostly for you geeks out there, but I know there are a few others who are going to be interested in following along. Please don&#39;t mind the grease and sawdust - that will be a permanent fixture I&#39;m sure. 

Oh, and if you find any bits lying around outside, just leave them inside the door - I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll figure out where they go eventually...
