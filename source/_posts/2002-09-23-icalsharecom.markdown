I&#39;ve already forgotten where I found this, but <a href="http://icalshare.com/">iCalShare.com</a> is a clearing house for iCal calendars you can subscribe to. One of interest I found was the <a href="http://www.amug.org/">Arizona Mac User&#39;s Group</a> (AMUG - calendar <a href="webcal://ical.mac.com/mbean/AMUG.ics">here</a>).
