I&#39;m doin&#39; the happy dance! Jim is one of my best friends, and after I mentioned to him that I really wanted a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201726831/redmonknet-20">the Cocoa programming book</a> but could not afford it, Jim used his own Amazon $$$ to get me a copy - and it just arrived!! I am *so* stoked!

I&#39;ve been working on Sid lately, and a new app, and this book is going to really jumpstart my m4d Cocoa sk1lz. Ooooohh, yeah.

Jim - THANK YOU!!!
