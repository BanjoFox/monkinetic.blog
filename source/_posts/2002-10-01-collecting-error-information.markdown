I&#39;m working on some code that emails error reports from my application. I&#39;m wondering:

1) what information I should collect in order to best debug the user&#39;s problem without infringing on their privacy, and 

2) how to determine if an error is of sufficient severity to warrant emailing the developer a bug report.

I know there are a number of developers that follow this site - how do you handle this sort of thing?
