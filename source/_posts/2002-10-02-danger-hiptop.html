[via <a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/">Hack the Planet</a>] <blockquote>The much-anticipated <a href="http://www.hiptop.com/">Danger Hiptop</a> wireless blogging device has been released. (<a href="http://www.hiptop.com/">link</a>)</blockquote>

Even near broke and unemployed, this little gadget has my geek-lust in overdrive. Wireless blogging, camera, mMMmmm... The Danger Hiptop is actually a spec - <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/products/overview.asp?phoneid=165302">T-Mobile&#39;s SideKick</a> is the first product based on it.
