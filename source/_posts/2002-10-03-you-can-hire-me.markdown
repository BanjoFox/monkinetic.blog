This is a reminder to all you out there that I&#39;m available for web development positions, esp. pure-Java and WebObjects. I&#39;m also interested in Mac OS X programming.

If you&#39;re looking for someone, you can find my <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/resume">resume online</a>, and can contact me <a href="mailto:steve@redmonk.net">here</a>.
