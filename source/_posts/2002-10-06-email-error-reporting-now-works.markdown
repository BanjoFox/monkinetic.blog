I finally got Sid&#39;s Applescript-powered email error reporting working today. It took ages to get it all right; it took getting the Applescript right, then making sure the Sid&#39;s Application Support folder was created, then writing out the error file, then finally reading in the script, filling in the parameters, can calling it. It works!!!
