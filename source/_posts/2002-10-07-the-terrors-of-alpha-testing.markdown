Heh. I released a new build of Sid to the alpha-victims today, and an hour later had 6 (!) emails from <a href="http://www.romanvenable.net/">Clark Venable</a>, tester extraordinaire. 

Clark has been testing various versions of <a href="http://conversant.macrobyte.net">Conversant</a> for a while now, and I think <a href="http://www.truerwords.net">Seth</a> has trained him well! Clark&#39;s bug reports are concise, complete, and include *what he did*, *what happened*, and *what he expected*. 

Of course, if I did not have bugs he&#39;d have nothing to report -), but I&#39;ll take the bug reports!
