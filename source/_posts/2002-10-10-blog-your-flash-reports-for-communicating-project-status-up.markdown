<blockquote>[via <a href="http://dijest.editthispage.com/">diJEST: a journal of extrapreneurial strategy and technology</a>]  Reporting a project&#39;s status upward shouldn&#39;t take more than 5 minutes. The technique is to boil everything down to a well structured, bullet-heavy, one-pager you can forward weekly or monthly. 

Flash reports, if timely and shared electronically, can eliminate a program management round-table meeting every week... (<a href="http://dijest.com/aka/categories/klogs/2002/09/04.html#a1980">link</a>)</blockquote>

Also see this post for some great flash-reporting tips. This is an area I struggled with in my last two positions - knowing how to report my project&#39;s status and how much to report.
