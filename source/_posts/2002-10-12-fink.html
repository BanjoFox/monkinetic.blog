I&#39;m in the process of updating my <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net">fink</a> to a version that works with Mac OS X 10.2.

If you use, or are planning to use, any of the gazillion of unix libraries or utilities out there for Mac OS X, fink is your best bet for getting them and keeping them up-to-date.
