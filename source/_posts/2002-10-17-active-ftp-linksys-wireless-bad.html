I haven&#39;t tracked down why yet, but I think I&#39;ve confirmed that software operating in active ftp mode (as opposed to passive ftp, in this case fink) is incompatible with the 802.11 implementation in the Linksysy WAP that I&#39;ve got. Whenever I tried to download software with fink my wireless connection would start going up and down, then just down, until I reset the WAP. I reconfigured fink to use passive FTP and am now having no problems. I&#39;m going to research this more a bit later and write it up here.
