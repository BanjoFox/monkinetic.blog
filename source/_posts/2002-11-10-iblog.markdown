If you use <a href="http://www.mac.com/">.Mac</a>, and want to start a weblog, <a href="http://www.lifli.com/index.htm">Lifli Software</a> has a solution: <a href="http://www.lifli.com/Products/iBlog/main.htm">iBlog</a>! After iPhoto came out, I had this same basic idea: an i-themed weblog application. Glad to see someone built it!
