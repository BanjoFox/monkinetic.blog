I was showing off some of my recent work to a  friend, and he commented &quot;It doesn&#39;t look like a [certain CMS] site at all!&quot;.

I take that as very high praise - I want the sites I build to be visually self-consistent, cohesive. No matter how good your CMS, if your site looks like a [some CMS here] site, then I don&#39;t believe your audience is seeing &quot;you&quot; in the site.

In the weblog world we talk a lot about your readers needing to hear your &quot;voice&quot; in the writing. I think voice is one of the most important aspects of powerful web-based communication. At the same time, I&#39;m re-discovering the power of the first impression. 

My goal with the design work I&#39;m doing right now is to create a conduit for that voice that is 1) visually impacting, and 2) conducive to allowing that voice to  be heard.
