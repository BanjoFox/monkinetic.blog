Over the last few days I&#39;ve been working on a new design for the website for my father&#39;s company. I really like the design, and it&#39;s working well in each area that I implement it.

What I had forgotten (it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve done this much design) is the sheer volume of details that have to be worked into a look. Here&#39;s a short list of site features that have needed design consideration:
<ul>
<li>main template</li>
<li>weblog template</li>
<li>section templates</li>
<li>main navigation</li>
<li>membership navigation</li>
<li>logos, slogans, other paraphernalia</li>
<li>discussion group message view template</li>
<li>search results template</li>
</ul>

Some sites I&#39;ve recently worked on (like <a href="http://www.redmonk.net">my own</a>) have developed over time: The main templates first, then the blog, then after a while maybe I&#39;d get around to  customizing the discussion group views, etc. This one has been a four-day marathon of design and production, and it has been incredibly satisfying. And tiring! -)
