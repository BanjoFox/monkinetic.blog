Jim has a <a href="http://www.gckeyboardnow.com/">new cause</a>:
<blockquote>Are you a Nintendo GameCube gamer, frustrated because you can&#39;t buy a keyboard for your console without paying huge money to an import dealer? (<a href="http://www.gckeyboardnow.com/">link</a>)</blockquote>
If you own a GameCube and would like to see a reasonably priced keyboard for it, check out this site, link to it, and most of all, fill out the form and let your voice be heard!

Disclosure: I do not, nor likely will I ever, own a GameCube (or any other console).
