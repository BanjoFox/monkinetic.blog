I&#39;m going to need to udpate <a href="http://sid.redmonk.net">Sid</a> to support the new weblog plugin API - this stuff is too good to pass up.

I&#39;ll also need to support the <a href="http://www.truerwords.net/2616">RSD work</a> that Daniel, Seth, and Brent have been hashing out over on <a href="http://www.truerwords.net">Truer Words</a>.
