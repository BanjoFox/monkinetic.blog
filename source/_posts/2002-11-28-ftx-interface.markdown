Web, Graphic Design: <a --="--" ftx_packages.gif"="ftx_packages.gif&quot;" href="&lt;!--#enclosure filename=" linkonly="true" urlonly="true">&quot;&gt;<img --="--" ftx_screen.jpg"="ftx_screen.jpg&quot;" linkonly="true" src="&lt;!--#enclosure filename=" urlonly="true" />&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;</a>While with Compass Technology Management, I led a web team in the design and development of a web interface for a large enterprise application. FTX is a web application that interfaces with Compass&#39; <a href="http://www.intellisafevault.com/">Intellisafe </a> product. 

I worked with the team and with Compass analysts and industry experts to define the workflow process involved, then designed the first several iterations of the web interface, including all branding and functional screens.
