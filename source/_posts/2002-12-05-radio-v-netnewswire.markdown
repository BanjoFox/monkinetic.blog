Dave on NetNewsWire&#39;s recent support for scripting:
<blockquote>For what it&#39;s worth, of course, Radio&#39;s aggregator has had infinite extendibility with scripts for a long time, on Mac OS X, with AppleScript, etc etc. (<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/12/04#When:4:11:49AM">link</a>)</blockquote>
Yes, Dave, but NetNewsWire is a full Mac OS X app, not a Mac OS X shell on a Mac OS 8 app with a Mac OS 7 interface. It also runs, without crashing, for days on end, and without ever making a <a href="http://www.romanvenable.net/index/2002/09/21#post149">bump</a> on the <a href="http://radio.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$7838?mode=topic">performance meter</a>.
