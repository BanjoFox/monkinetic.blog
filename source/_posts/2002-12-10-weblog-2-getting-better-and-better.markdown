Conversant&#39;s Weblog 2 plugin is getting better and better! While Jodi and I were away in Northern California this weekend, it gained the ability to specify which custom field to use for weblog categories, and really streamlined the channel management tools (see the right side of this page for what I mean by channels).

Every day, better and better...
