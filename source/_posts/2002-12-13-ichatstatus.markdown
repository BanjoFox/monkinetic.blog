Clark just showed up on my iChat buddylist, and instead of a status, there was some musical notes and the name of a Santana song! Whoa! Cool! So I harassed him about it and he pointed to a little prefpane app called <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/php/dlpage.php?id=17192&amp;kind=1&amp;db=mac">iChatStatus</a>. It updates your iChat status to show the currently playing song in iTunes. Coool! Also included are aplescripts to let iChatStatus show things like the web page you&#39;re currently viewing, or the active application, and other goodies.
