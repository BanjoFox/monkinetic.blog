We&#39;re finally getting around to decorating  our recently purchased tree tonight. I spent all night last night getting the darn thing to stand up (more or less) straight (stupid live tree -)) and getting the lights on.

So this evening we&#39;re going to pop in some Christmas tunes, and smack some deco on the tree. Should be fun.

I have to point out that going to the church Christmas party in short sleeves (we live in Arizona and it&#39;s 65&degree; out) makes it hard to get into the spirit of things.
