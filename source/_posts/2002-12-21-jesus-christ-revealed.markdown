Greg <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/1653">replied</a> to let me know that the R.E.M. song I was looking for last night is in fact a cover of a <a href="http://frontlinearts.com/bigstar/">Big Star</a> song by Alex Chilton, from the &quot;Third / Sister Lovers&quot; <a href="http://frontlinearts.com/bigstar/third.html">album</a>.

Thanks Greg!
