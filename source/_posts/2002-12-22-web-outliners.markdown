I composed my <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic/2002/12/20#item1652">R.E.M. and Jesus Christ</a> post in <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">OmniOutliner</a> (for which I still need to get a license - outlines of &lt; 20 lines are useless) and it reminded me once again of my love of writing in an outliner. I really would like to have a &quot;compose-in-outline&quot; mode in Sid one day.
