I&#39;m going to kick myself for this later I&#39;m sure (for making commitments I can&#39;t, or won&#39;t, keep) but I think this next year I&#39;m going to try to sit at the computer less, but get more done while I&#39;m there. This includes blogging, since it&#39;s the only writing practice I get, and I need to focus outwards sometimes.
