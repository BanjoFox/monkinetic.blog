Mark Pilgrim is <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/27.html#pushing_the_envelope">doing something cool</a> with his weblog posts: by searching the posts for HTML <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/text.html#h-9.2.1">CITE </a>tags, he now has <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/citations/">a view</a> of his posts sorted by who he was citing. Very useful. I don&#39;t think he needed the more-semantic-than-thou snarkiness to make his point though.
