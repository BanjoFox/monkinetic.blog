If you&#39;d like to follow every mesage posted to this site, but don&#39;t feel the need to respond, you can subscribe to a new RSS feed I just created:

http://www.redmonk.net/discussion/recent.rss

This should give you the last 7 days of messages posted to the discussion group - that means every weblog post and every reply, too.
