For the most part, I find that Jakob Nielsen severly strains my attention span. However, today Jodi and I were perusing Barnes &amp; Noble and I ran across <a href="http://www.useit.com/homepageusability/">Homepage Usability</a>.

Homepage Usability looks like an interesting book with a lot of cool information about the sites that are analyzed. It seemed a bit long-winded in places (big surprise) but in a book it&#39;s easy to flip ahead. -)
