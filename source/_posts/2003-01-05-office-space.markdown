Well, I was getting tired if working in the living room, so Jodi and I went about redoing our home office today.

We went to Home Depot, and on the advice of my father (who has had a home office since I was, well, since I wasn&#39;t) asked for a damaged solid-core wood door. We found such a door and procured it for 1/2 price ($20!). We took it home, and iI mounted it on two sets of wooden shelves - instant desk!

The desk is about 30% larger than the other one we have (that I&#39;m now using, since at the moment I have only my laptop) giving Jodi a lot more needed room. Best thing is, we only spent $26 on our new office! Sweet!
