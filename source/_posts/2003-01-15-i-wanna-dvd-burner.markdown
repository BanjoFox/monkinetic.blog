I never needed a DVD burner. Until today. I decided I need to do some much needed backing up of my personal data, and realized that my user directory is 5 GB. Now, that didn&#39;t seem big to me until I realized that to back it up will take about 8 CDRs. And that&#39;s assuming I can break my data into full 650 mb portions. Phooey.


Now I wanna DVD burner.
