New column by Jonathon Peterson: <a href="http://www.corante.com/amateur/">Amateur Hour</a>.

<blockquote>&quot; Today, the rapid proliferation of cheap professional-quality media-making tools, paired with the drastic decrease in the cost of content distribution is leading to a quiet, but quite real revolution in the quantity and quality of &quot;amateur&quot; content.&quot;</blockquote>

Looks interesting.
