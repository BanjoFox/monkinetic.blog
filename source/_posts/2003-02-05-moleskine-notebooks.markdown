I&#39;d never heard of <a href="http://www.moleskine.co.uk/main.html">Moleskine notebooks</a>, but they seem to have quite the reputation. I&#39;ve long used hardbound unlined notebooks as sketchbooks and journals. Now I find that <a href="http://www.moleskine.co.uk/gallery.html">these really cool bound notebooks</a> can be <a href="http://www.mojolondon.co.uk/Products/moleskine_large.html">purchased online</a>.


Dad, looks like you&#39;d love these too.
