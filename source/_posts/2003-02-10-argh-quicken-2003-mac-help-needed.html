If there are any Quicken 2003 for the Mac users out there, I need some help.


We have two accounts that we have set up to download transactions online. One account is a checking account, the other a credit card account.


Now, we download the transactions, everything works fine. In the chanking account there is a transaction where a check was written <i>to the credit card account</i>, and that check has no category. There&#39;s a transaction already in the credit card register that reflects the check that was written.


Now, the fun part. When we assign a category to the check transaction that tells Quicken that it was a trnasfer to the credit cards account <i>Quicken creates a NEW, duplicate transaction in the credit card register</i>. Is there any way to tell Quicken *not* to create that new transaction? It doesn&#39;t seem to see that there is an existing identical transaction already there. Ack!!


If anyone can help, it will save Jodi and I a lot of angst and frustration.
