Rats. I wonder how much <a href="http://www.idgexecforums.com/demo/">this</a> costs? I had no idea there was a popular geek-ish conference going on in town! Demo 2003 is happenin&#39; in Scottsdale, AZ, just a scant 20 miles away!


I wonder if there&#39;s a place to go to find out all the conferences that are coming to town?
