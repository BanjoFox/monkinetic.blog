I spent the morning working at the local Starbuck&#39;s. It was not one of the <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/retail/wireless.asp">unwired shops</a>, but that wasn&#39;t a bad thing, as I needed some undistracted creative time. As a result, I got a good start on the design of a mailing I&#39;m going to be doing shortly to some potential clients.
