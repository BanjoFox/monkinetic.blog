I just got back from re-introducing the <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/1350">Green Machine</a> to the dirty stuff. Seems some local bmx-ers have converted a local vacant lot into The BumpLands - mounds of dirt of every shape and size (and level of rain-saturation) just perfect for falling off of!


Did I mention I&#39;m still getting used to <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic/2003/02/24#item1846">being attached</a> to my bike? Ouch.
