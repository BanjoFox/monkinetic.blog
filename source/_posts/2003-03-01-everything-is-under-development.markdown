I just noticed that O&#39;Reilly has a <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/policy/">Policy DevCenter</a> to go along with their  other developer-oriented sites. I wonder if we&#39;ll start to see books like &quot;The Constitution in a Nutshell&quot;, &quot;Practical CopyLeft&quot;, &quot;Congressional Framework Essentials&quot; showing up on <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/prdindex.html">the booklist</a>?
