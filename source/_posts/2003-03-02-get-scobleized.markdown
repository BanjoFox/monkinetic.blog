If you&#39;re in the tech business, writing software, <a href="http://www.apple.com">building hardware</a>, or <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx">making</a> an <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.mspx">OS</a>, you need to be reading <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Robert Scoble</a>.


He rankles me sometimes, but I can tell he&#39;s put a lot of thought into stuff. I sure wish Apple had Scoble working for them - NEC&#39;s lucky.
