Thomas P.M. Barnett writes for the Navy War College on the <a href="http://www.nwc.navy.mil/newrulesets/ThePentagonsNewMap.htm">new understanding of the world</a> from the Pentagon&#39;s viewpoint. It explains a lot of where our government sees the world going, and what our place in it will be. 
<blockquote>Since the end of the cold war, the United States has  been trying to come up with an operating theory of the world and a  military strategy to accompany it.&#0160; Now there&#39;s a leading contender.&#0160; It  involves identifying the problem parts of the world and aggressively shrinking  them.</blockquote>
