I&#39;m watching a <a href="rtsp://felter.org/SXSW.sbp">webcast</a> from <a href="http://www.sxsw.com/">SXSW</a>, not even sure which one, but it looks like <a href="http://www.boingboing.com">Cory Doctorow</a> talking and sounds vaguely <a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>-ish.

Interesting idea: The role of the technologist is to provide opportunities for the entertainment industry, and the role of the entertainment industry is to seek legislative and injuctive relief from those opportunities.

UPDATE: Aaron informs me that this is &quot;The Hollywood Agenda&quot; (<a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/panels/tuesday/">description on this page</a>) indeed starring Cory Doctorow.
