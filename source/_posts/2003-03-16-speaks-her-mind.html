Jodi&#39;s site is coming along nicely, and she&#39;s updating it more frequently these days.

Jodi is my unfortunate web design and IA guinea pig. I often will be working on something and be like &quot;Hey hon, check this out...&quot; I can judge my work from the level of perplexity on her face. -) She&#39;s pretty right on so far - if she&#39;s unconvinced of a feature&#39;s usefulness or obviousness, it usually means I need to redesign it.

Jodi&#39;s da bomb.
