<a href="http://www.macasylum.com/">MacAsylum</a> has released an interesting extension for Apple&#39;s December Developer Tools: a set of configuration files called <a href="http://www.macasylum.com/">WebSiteProj</a> that adds PHP Website and HTML Website project types to Project Builder.

This is kinda cool - I&#39;ve already started playing around with using it to manage the many templates I have to create when working on Conversant sites. This could be very useful.
