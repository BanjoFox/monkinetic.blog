Last night I added a second monitor to my TiBook - and I&#39;m experiencing some strange crashes that <i>seem</i> to be iChat related.  

Once I launch iChat, after about 2 minutes the machine locks up. The cursor continues to work, but nothing is responsive. If I let it sit there, after a minute or two sometimes I&#39;ll usually get some nasty artifacts on part of the screen - often on some iChat window, but not always. The only way to recover is a three-finger salute.

I&#39;m still trying to confirm/deny iChat&#39;s involvement, but I&#39;m wondering if anyone else has seen this behavior? (Whether iChat-related or not.)

Stats: TiBook 667/30/512, Sylvania F72 (17&quot;) monitor.
