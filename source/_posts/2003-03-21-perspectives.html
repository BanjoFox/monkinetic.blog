Jodi <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/index/2003/03/20#item148">posted last night</a> about an Iranian woman we got to spend last evening with. She and her family survived the ten year war with Iraq, and had to flee their homes on the Iran/Iraq border when Saddam&#39;s troops came. It was fascinating to hear.

Roya came to the states, and taught herself to read and write english, then went into nursing school (yet another language!) - I have nothing but respect for her.

Interestingly, even though Roya is Iranian, she has a lot of compassion for the Iraqi people right now - she too knows what it&#39;s like to be on the receiving end.
