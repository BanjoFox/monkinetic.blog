Big surprise, I hacked on mygannt.py some more this weekend, and it&#39;s now called sgannt.py. Ostensibly for Simple Gannt (though it&#39;s not <i>so</i> simple anymore) but more because it sounds cool to pronounce it &quot;scant&quot;. -)

The one thing I really like about sgannt is that it&#39;s personal. I designed the chart format, trying to keep it simple but attractive. I want my clients to feel comfortable looking at it, and get all the information I can give them. It&#39;s not perfect, and hopefully it will get better, but I think I&#39;ve struck a good balance between information design and visual design.

Sgantt now reads an OPML file on stdin as input, and generates very nice PDF. It has it&#39;s own config file format (modelled after <a href="http://www.analog.cx">analog</a>&#39;s since that&#39;s the format I&#39;ve been using most recently) where I can spec fonts, margins, banner colors, default line widths and column marker colors. This has been a really good experience for me, and I&#39;m going to write up a howto soon on some of the technologies involved, to hopefully save someone else some of the headaches I had.
