This is too amazing to be true, but it is: Palestine-born US Citizen, and Intel employee Mike Hawash was arrested as a material witness by the FBI&#39;s Joint Terrorism Task Force and is being held without access to a lawyer, without being chanrged, in solitary confinement.

This is absolutely unacceptable. Wired has <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/conflict/0,2100,58326,00.html">an article</a> posted about it, and Mike&#39;s friend&#39;s and family have put up a website at http://www.freemikehawash.org/. Please consider donating to Mike&#39;s defense fund and to help his family.

I&#39;m sorry - terrorism or no, this kind of blatant trampling of the established rights of a citizen is unacceptable.
