If it weren&#39;t <a href="http://www.latimes.com/technology/la-fi-apple11apr11004423,1,144740.story?coll=la%2Dheadlines%2Dtechnology">in the LATimes</a> (user:<i>annoying</i>, password:<i>annoying</i>), I&#39;d expect to see it on <a href="http://www.crazyapplerumors.com/">Crazy Apple Rumors</a>... Apple is evidently in talks with Vivendi to buy Universal Music Group, in a move related to <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2003/04/20030402175109.shtml">rumors</a> of a new Apple online music service.

Update: The BBC is running <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2940355.stm">an article</a> on this, including the usual doom-and-gloom:
<blockquote>...analysts told BBC News Online that such a deal would make little sense for Apple. 

 &quot;It wouldn&#39;t change our recommendation on Apple stock,&quot; said one analyst. 

 &quot;But since we were already recommending clients to sell, things couldn&#39;t get much worse.&quot;</blockquote>
Geez.
