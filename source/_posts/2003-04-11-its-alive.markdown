After not being able to use my second monitor  for ages, while it sat dead on my desk, taunting me, today I upgraded to <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=25405">Mac OS X 10.2.5</a> and voila! No more monitor-induced crashes!!! My TiBook does NOT require service, and I am now happily computing on twice the screen real estate! w00t!
