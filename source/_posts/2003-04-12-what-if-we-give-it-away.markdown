While looking for the previous link to the lyrics for Welcome To The Occupation, I found out that Murmurs.com started a peer-to-peer network called <a href="http://remexhibit.murmurs.com/rem/themusic/giveitaway/">&quot;give it away&quot;</a> for trading live and unreleased R.E.M. tracks. Evidently they&#39;ve run this by the band, since the band also gave them permission to include B-Sides from the various singles as well as fan-club-only releases.

This is SO cool! I&#39;ve already gotten an incredible version of <a href="http://www.geocities.com/mmeyer_hermann/Cuyahoga.html">Cuyahoga</a> from the 2001 MTV Unplugged 2 concert. How beautiful.

By the way, the service name comes from <a href="http://www.geocities.com/mmeyer_hermann/GiveItAway.html">this song</a>.
