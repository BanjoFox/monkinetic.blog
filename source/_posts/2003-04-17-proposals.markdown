I&#39;m spending the day writing a proposal for a potential client, for some corporate identity/print/web work. It will be a good project if I can make the proposal attractive enough (financially, and without screwing myself). I absolutely <i>hate</i> writing proposals. I suck at it, it&#39;s hard work, but it&#39;s absolutely necessary.

After it&#39;s done I have two more. Someone shoot me, please
