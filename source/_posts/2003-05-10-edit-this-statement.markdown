Dave <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/05/10#editThisPageInDesktopTextEditors">says</a>:

&gt;The other Web content management systems don&#39;t even have Edit This Page buttons yet.

Um, Dave, Conversant has had this capability since the beginning, at least since I started using it almost 3 years ago. In Conversant I can even make the Edit This Page button say whatever I want it to say.
