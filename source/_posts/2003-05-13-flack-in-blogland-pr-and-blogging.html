<a href="http://llareggolb.blogspot.com">Michael Clarke posted (it&#39;s an old post, but I just found his weblog) <a href="http://llareggolb.blogspot.com/2003_04_01_llareggolb_archive.html#200208624">some mildly tortured self-analytical thoughts</a> about being a PR flack and what happens when PR and Blogging collide...

Since I&#39;ve recently been thinking some about <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkineticextras/software/weblogs/2003/03/05/webloggeneration.html">blogging and business</a>, Michael&#39;s PR POV is good stuff.</a>
