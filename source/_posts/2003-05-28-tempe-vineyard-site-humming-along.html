A while back I finished up and launched a new site for our church, the <a href="http://www.tempevineyard.com">Tempe Vineyard</a>. Jodi and I are the defacto webmasters, which is fine with us. It&#39;s giving us the exciting opportunity to be the web evangelists within the church, helping members and leaders understand  they have at their disposal.

There&#39;s <a href="http://www.tempevineyard.com">a weblog</a>, a Resources section with <a href="http://www.tempevineyard.com/resources/sermons/">sermon notes</a>, a page listing the <a href="http://www.tempevineyard.com/lifegroups/index.html">home groups</a> that are running weekly, and other goodies in the pipeline!
