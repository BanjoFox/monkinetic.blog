Well, things have been pretty quiet around here lately, and there&#39;s a good reason: after a year of unemployment, I have a shot at a contractor position with a company in Southern California. I&#39;ll be working from home, which is great.

The company is largely linux-based, and uses a lot of open source tools, including <a href="http://openacs.org">OpenACS</a>, which I mentioned yesterday. So I&#39;ve been head down in <a href="http://www.tcl.tk">TCL</a> and ADP, the template language OpenACS uses, all this week. Ah, the brain-stretching!

Anyway, things will continue to be light for a while around here as I get my feet under me.
