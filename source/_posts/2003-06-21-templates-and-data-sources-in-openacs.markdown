Jade Rubick&#39;s <a href="http://rubick.com:8002/openacs/templating">A Quick Intro to OpenACS Templating</a> is actually an excellent guide to how the .tcl, .adp, and .xql datasources interact in an OpenACS page.

Of particular interest is that it shows the magic that happens to populate your data variables in the tcl from the SQL query.
