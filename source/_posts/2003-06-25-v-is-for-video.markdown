I got a iChat video chat invitation from <a href="http://www.mcmains.net/ruminations">Sean McMains</a> today, and I was like &quot;I don&#39;t have a camera...&quot; When it popped up it was a one-way video chat - I could <a --="--" href="&lt;!--#enclosure filename=" ichat1wayvideo.pdf"="iChat1WayVideo.pdf&quot;" linkonly="true" urlonly="true">&quot;&gt;see Sean</a> (PDF) and he got an audio feed on his end. Very very very cool!

In the &quot;of-course-they&#39;d-think-of-that&quot; department, when an audio/video chat pops up, iChat automatically pauses iTunes, and restarts it upon closing the chat window. So nice. smile
