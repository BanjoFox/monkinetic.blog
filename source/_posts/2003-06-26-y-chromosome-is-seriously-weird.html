One thing I don&#39;t talk about much on this weblog (maybe never before) is that Jodi and I have been trying to have children for almost 4 years. We&#39;ve explored various treatment options, and suspect what they call &quot;male factor&quot;. Yes, that means what you think it means. Due to our current financial situation we&#39;re not actively exploring treatment right now.

I mention all this to explain why I found this Wired article so interesting: <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,59295,00.html">Male Chromosome Seriously Weird</a>. The article discusses how researchers are now finding that the Y chromosome, which is responsible for a human becoming male, may also contribute to male infertility.
