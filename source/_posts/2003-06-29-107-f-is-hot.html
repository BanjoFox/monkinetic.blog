<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2003/06/28.html#a3561">Scoble says</a>: &quot;I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not in Silicon Valley right now, though. I heard it was 107 in my dad&#39;s car in San Jose yesterday. Whew.&quot;

Hey Robert, be glad you&#39;re not in Phoenix then! It was a pleasant 110&degree; in the shade today! Cars usually get 15 or more degrees hotter. 

Of course, we&#39;d still love for you to come visit - hey, it&#39;s my birthday tomorrow - we&#39;re having cake and ice cream at 7:00pm. Stop on by!  I promise it won&#39;t be *too* hot! smile
