John Robb is <a href="http://feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=john+robb+userland&amp;sort=date">leaving UserLand</a>. No reason given, and none expected.

This is pure, unadulterated speculation, but I wonder if <a href="http://www.userland.com">UserLand</a> is going to be acquired?
