No time to blog this properly, but Bill <a href="http://bbrown.info/blogs/bblog/2003_07_06_diamonds.cfm#105785229580287939">blogs an IM conversation</a> we had about Mark Pilgrim&#39;s &quot;Winer Watch&quot;. See Bill&#39;s site for links.

BTW - not having enough time is a Good Thing (tm). I&#39;m too busy <i>working</i>. Hot damn!
