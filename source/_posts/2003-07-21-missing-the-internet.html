Oh, I miss the internet. &quot;But Steve,&quot; you say, &quot;you&#39;re on it now!&quot;

With all respect to my fairly wired grandmother, a 49k AOL connection does not &quot;The Internet&quot; make. In just over a day I&#39;ll be back home, basking in the wireless broadband goodness that is my home network. Yum!
