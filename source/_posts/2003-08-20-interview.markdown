In about an hour I&#39;m going to my first face-to-face job interview in 14 months. I&#39;m nervous.

I&#39;m also qualified for, and interested in, the position. I firmly believe that I can help this company take a good product and turn it into a great one.

If I am miraculously offered, and take, the position, I&#39;ll be arriving well after all the dot-com party guests have gone home. But I&#39;m still excited.

I really want this position. Maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m terrified.
