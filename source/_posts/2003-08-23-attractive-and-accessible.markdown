I&#39;m reading Mark Pilgrim&#39;s <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/">Dive Into Accessibility</a> site, and also Joe Clark&#39;s <a href="">Building Accessible Websites</a>. Both are invaluable websites.

However, as a designer, I must note that both &quot;suffer&quot; from a very minimalistic approach to the design. I&#39;d like to see some sites that are attractive and <i>expressive</i> and are still accessible.

<i>Update:</i> Just as I was about to post this I remembered the <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>, which is both visually stunning, and Bobby AAA and Section 508 certified. Not bad!
