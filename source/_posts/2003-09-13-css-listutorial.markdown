Russ Weakley (of <a href="http://www.maxdesign.com.au">Max Design</a>) <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/2301">responds</a> to my previous comments about the lists on the Max Design site. He also kindly points us to a <a href="http://www.maxdesign.com.au/presentation/listutorial/">new tutorial</a> he&#39;s put together on using background images with CSS to build even more creative lists.

Nice work, Russ!
