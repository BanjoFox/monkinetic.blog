Tim Bray is <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/09/12/KeynoteNoHTML">upset</a> that <a href="http://www.apple.com/keynote/">Keynote</a> does not have an HTML export feature.

I agree it&#39;s a lousy feature to be missing. But I would have thought that Tim (being an <a href="http://www.xml.com/axml/testaxml.htm">author of XML</a> and all) would have realized that Keynote&#39;s file format is XML (known as <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2002/tn2067.html">APXML</a>), and can be transformed as desired.

I had assumed that someone would have already written a converter for the APXML format to some kind of HTML, but I can&#39;t seem to find anything.
