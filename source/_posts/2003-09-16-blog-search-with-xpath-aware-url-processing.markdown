Jon Udell <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/09/16.html#a797">points</a> to Kimbro Staken&#39;s new <a href="http://www.xmldatabases.org/WK/blog/262?t=item">XPath-searchable weblog software</a>. Very cool!

The coolest part of Kimbo&#39;s post though is this: by supporting HTTP PUT in his software, he can edit pages using <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/">OmniWeb</a>&#39;s source viewer/editor. I had heard of the little supported PUT method of HTTP, but had no idea that OmniWeb supported it. 

That simply rocks, and harkens back to the original <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/WorldWideWeb.html">WWW app</a> (written by Tim Berners-Lee on a NeXT computer) which was both a browser and an editor (though it would only edit file:\/\/ pages.
