Mike McCracken&#39;s web hosting at disco.ucsd.edu blew up on him, so he&#39;s moved his site. He can&#39;t get at it to redirect the old one, so I told him I&#39;d pass on the info on his <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/">new site</a>.

quoteHi, since I can&#39;t redirect disco.ucsd.edu, I have to try to spread the word about my weblog moving the hard way. Could you post that my weblog, formerly at http://disco.ucsd.edu/blog is now at http://michael-mccracken.net/blog/ ?

Thanks,<br />
-mike
