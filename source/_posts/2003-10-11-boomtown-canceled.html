Argh!! NBC finally kills the last reason to turn to channel 12, as they <a href="http://www.thefutoncritic.com/cgi/gofuton.cgi?action=newswire&amp;id=6185">remove </a> &#39;Boomtown&#39; from <a href="http://www.nbc.com/nbc/header/TV_Schedule/index.html">their lineup</a>. Boomtown was my best reason to watch TV, actually tied with CBS&#39;s <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/without_a_trace/">&#39;Without A Trace&#39;</a> for the best drama - maybe even best show - on television, IMHO.
