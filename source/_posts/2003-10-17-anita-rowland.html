According to <a href="http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/2003/10/17.html#a966">Rogers Cadenhead</a>, Anita Rowland is recovering from surgery:

quoteIn the space of two weeks, weblogger Anita Rowland has been diagnosed with diabetes and probable ovarian cancer and undergone surgery, for which her doctors are &quot;cautiously optimistic,&quot; according to a friend.endquote

Anita has been an occasional visitor and commenter on this site, and her <a href="http://www.anitarowland.com/">blog</a> is always an interesting read. Please keep her in your prayers.

I had not seen yet the Anita herself had posted about her <a href="http://www.anitarowland.com/gmarchives/00001428.html">diabetes and possible ovarian cancer diagnosis</a>. Get well soon, Anita!!
