Oh, man, I <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/10/20/foolproof">needed a good guffaw</a>. smile

>This is generally beyond my capabilities, since it involves doing math in my head, but I cheated and used my wireless-Internet-enabled laptop to do the calculation in the Google calculator, thus utilizing over $3000 dollars worth of hardware and software locally and God-only-knows how much hardware remotely ("there are fields, endless fields, where Google servers are no longer born, they are grown") in order to compensate for my inability to count to 8 without wandering off and logging on to IRC.

Thanks Mark.
