Scott Johnson is at it again. After better grokking a suggestion I made, he <a href="http://feedster.com/blog/archives/231_Feedster_Cache_Now_Supports_RSS_Output.html">implemented a new feature</a> on Feedster: getting an RSS version of a single cached blog post, by passing in the url of a permalink for that post.
