Well, I was going to write an essay on what I&#39;m thankful for this year, but it would be way too long and I&#39;m headed out of town tomorrow early.  So here&#39;s the short list:  1) My awesome, loving [wife][1], Jodi.  2) God giving us the grace to survive 18 mos of unemployment to arrive here with [two][2] [jobs][3].  Thanks God.
