Yes, Jodi and I both managed to contract the flu while out of town for the holiday. I think I got it on the plane headed out east, and, well, Jodi got it from me. 

I spent a couple of days fighting a fever (which got up above 104 at one point), chills and aches and pains, and eventually had to postpone my return flight a day while I try to recover enough to travel.

Poor Jodi started with a small cough yesterday before she left for Arizona (we had seperate flights due to ticketing issues) and she&#39;s now bedridden at our home in Gilbert. Crap.

I think having a sick spouse and not being able to do anything about it is one of the more difficult aspects of marriage. Hang in there, Jo, I&#39;ll be home soon!!
