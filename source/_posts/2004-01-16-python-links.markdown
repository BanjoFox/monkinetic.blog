Jim posted a useful link to a new <a href="http://www.cardboard.nu/archives/000138.html">list of all the __magic__ variables</a> that are used in python modules to make them play nice with scripts, other modules, and documentation systems. Included in the page is a link to something I&#39;d never used before, the &quot;amazing <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-pydoc.html">pydoc</a> module&quot; which looks super useful. Much nicer than typing help(foo) in the python intepreter IMO.
