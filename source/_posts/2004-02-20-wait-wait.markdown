Jodi and I went with my new boss David and his wife Kristy to see the live taping of <a href="http://www.npr.org">NPR</a>&#39;s <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/index.html">Wait, Wait Don&#39;t Tell Me</a> at the <a href="http://www.arizonabiltmore.com/">Arizona Biltmore Hotel and Spa</a>. We had a lot of fun, even if it was (relatively) cold out. Adam Felber, comedian and <a href="http://felbers.net/mt/">blogger</a>, won the quiz, bad jokes were made, and good times were had by all.
