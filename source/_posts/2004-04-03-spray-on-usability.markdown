<a href="http://daringfireball.net/">John Gruber</a>, a Mac-user and sometime developer, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/04/spray_on_usability">comments on</a> Eric Raymond&#39;s recent <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cups-horror.html">Linux-usability</a> rant. He makes some really good points. Desktop Linux is not going to grow in market share with any real speed until it&#39;s *enjoyable* to use. That means it looks good, gets out of your way when you want it to, and is right there with the right options when you need it. You know, kind of like a <a href="http://www.apple.com">Mac</a>.
