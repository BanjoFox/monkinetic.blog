<a href="http://jim.roepcke.com/6832">Jim Roepcke&#39;s weblog: Finishing what I started</a>

Jim has been a great friend to me over the years, from mailing-list-co-member to development mentor to friendly acquaintance, to real friend. I&#39;ve watched him go through some really hard times and tried to stand with him as best I could.

I am so *stoked* that Jim is headed back to school, and has gotten himself out from under all the debt he found himself in as a result of the aforementioned hard times. Jodi and I are trying to do the same, tightening our budget so that we can retire some long-standing debt. It&#39;s incredibly freeing.

<a href="http://biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=PROV+22:7&amp;language=english&amp;version=NIV&amp;showfn=on&amp;showxref=on">Proverbs 22:7</a>: *The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.*

It&#39;s the truth, folks.

Congratulations, Jim and Cheryl! Good luck with your studies Jim, and Cheryl - we want pics of Cyan and Wavie! :-)
