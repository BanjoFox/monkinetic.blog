This is a short post to say that monkinetic is going to be moving! This will be the last post on this site ( http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic) until I can get my content ported and the DNS switched. If you&#39;d like to continue following along in the meantime, the new monkinetic can be found at:

rm.bookdev.com

See you there!

Update: please use http://redmonk.net from now on. Thanks!
