Ok, when Jeff Veen <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000533.html">pointed</a> to the new blogger design, I thought, how good can it be? I mean, the previous design wasn&#39;t too bad...


Oh my. It&#39;s <a href="http://blogger.com/start">much improved</a>! It&#39;s understandable. It&#39;s faaaaaaaast.

Way to go, <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com">Adaptive Path</a>.

Update: The site is, admittedly, oriented to first-timers who likely don&#39;t even know what a blog is, so the interface can seem somewhat &quot;fisher-price&quot;. (Jodi compared it to Windows XP. *shudder*.) But it&#39;s more attractive than XP by a long shot IMHO.

I wonder if they&#39;ve redone the backend interface as well?
