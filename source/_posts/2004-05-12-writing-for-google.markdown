Daring Fireball: <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/05/writing_for_google">Writing for Google</a>
&gt;Neither of the last two articles were meant for you, however. They were written for Google. Or, more specifically, for people using search engines to find an answer to the same problems I had in the aforementioned articles.

John&#39;s certainly not the first to notice that when a fairly regular blogger writes something good or useful, it gets <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GoogleJuice">Google-juice</a> pretty fast. He has, however, provided a good summary of how to write so that your article will show up quickly. Please use responsibly.
