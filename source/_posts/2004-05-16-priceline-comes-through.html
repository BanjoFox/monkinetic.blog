Jodi and I are going to San Diego for Memorial Day weekend. We originally thought we&#39;d do the camping thing to be cheap, but after looking into the prices for camps (not as cheap as you might think)  we decided that we may be able to get a hotel for not a whole lot more.

So... we decided to try our hand at <a href="http://priceline.com">Priceline.com</a> and see what we could get. We were finding rates at other sites around $120 for a motel, so we decided to put in a lowball price (for a holiday weekend) at Priceline and specify that we wanted a 3-star hotel. :-)

Well, Priceline came through! We ended up with a room at a *4-star* hotel, the <a href="http://manchestergrand.hyatt.com/property/index.jhtml">Manchester Grand Hyatt</a> in downtown San Diego, and we&#39;re not paying much more than we would have for a campground!!

Woohoo!!!
