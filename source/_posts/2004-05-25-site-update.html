As some of you may have figured, I&#39;ve basically finished switching this site over to WordPress, and it&#39;s back at the root of <a href="http://redmonk.net/">redmonk.net</a>. LIkely you&#39;ve been redirected to redmonk.net from http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic.

I did make sure that the <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/monkinetic/rss">old RSS feed</a> will continue to work, but the new feed is here: <a href="http://redmonk.net/feed/rss2/">redmonk.net RSS</a>.

As soon as I get the last 4 years of posts imported into WP, I&#39;ll have a redirector setup so that all the links out there (all 4 of them) to old content will get directed to the right place. What fun!
