&gt;&quot;Wiggle your big toe.&quot; It just popped into my head. &quot;Wiggle your big toe.&quot; I began to focus on that phrase, and I recalled the scene from the movie. The Bride was going to get out of that situation, and only calm reflection and concentration was going to work for her.

There have been a few times in my life when elements of pop culture gave me the idea or concept I needed to make it through an emotional experience. Some condemn pop culture as shallow - which it can be - but it&#39;s also a deep well of folk understanding that is neatly packaged in easily-remembered snippets.
