Apple announces new <a href="http://www.apple.com/powermac/">Power Mac G5s</a> today, including a <a href="http://www.apple.com/powermac/design.html">liquid-cooled</a> dual 2.5 ghz model. I wonder how much power those 2.5 Ghz chips are using? It must be putting off a lot of heat to require a liquid cooling system.
