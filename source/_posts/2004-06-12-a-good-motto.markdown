Another Word for Nerd: <a href="http://weblog.mrbill.net/archives/2004/05/28/a-good-motto/">a good motto</a>:

>A Man should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently and die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.

>-- Robert Heinlein
