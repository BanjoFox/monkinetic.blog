>None of this bodes well for Microsoft and the profits it enjoyed thanks to its API power. The new API is HTML, and the new winners in the application development marketplace will be the people who can make HTML sing.

Joel is a *really* good writer and his company makes a web-based bug tracking system called <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ">FogBugz</a>. He&#39;s been a <abbr title="(Microsoft&#39;s) Visual Basic">VB</abbr> developer for many years and has written some great articles on why Microsoft and its  technologies are so predominant - articles that make me, a Mac user, really think while cringing. :-)
