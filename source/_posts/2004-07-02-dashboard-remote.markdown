Hmmm. Seeing as each <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/dashboard.html">Dashboard</a> gadget is <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_06.html#005876">just a web page</a>, I wonder if they could be delivered remotely? I can envision writing corporate intranet-based gadgets for use by employees on our LAN.
