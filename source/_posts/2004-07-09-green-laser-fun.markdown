Gadget Madness <a href="http://www.gadgetmadness.com/archives/20040706-review_green_laser_pointer_ii_from_thinkgeek.php">reviews the Green Laser Pointer</a> from <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/">ThinkGeek</a>:
&gt;5 out of 5 Predators agree that the green laser pointer is bad because they are usually attached to a semi-automatic weapon of some sort, which means the spillage of glowing green Predator blood. If you see a Predator, for pete&#39;s sake don&#39;t be stupid and whip out your green laser pointer and shine it at him. This really pisses them off, so don&#39;t say we didn&#39;t warn you.
