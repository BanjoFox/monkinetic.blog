Now that I&#39;ve got all my archives imported, I was watching the apache logs scroll by when the <a href="http://search.msn.com/msnbot.htm">MSNBot</a> requested this <a href="http://redmonk.net/archives/2000/10/10/the-anti-brent">rant from Oct. 2000</a>. It&#39;s got me wondering if my thoughts on the matter have changed any in 4 years. More on that later.
