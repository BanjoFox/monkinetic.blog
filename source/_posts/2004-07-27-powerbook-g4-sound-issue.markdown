If you have a Powerbook G4 and your sound starts horking out, run the Apple Hardware Test (boot from the included disk, hold down Option and select &quot;Apple Hardware Test&quot;). It&#39;s possible that you&#39;ll get a logic board error <code>2ISS/1/5: 0x40</code>. If so, call AppleCare (you *did* get AppleCare, right?) and they&#39;ll hook you up.
