|photomatt|, lead developer of |WordPress|, posted a <a href="http://photomatt.net/2004/08/01/weeds-in-the-garden/">kick-ass blog entry</a> about how WordPress handles comment spam, his approach to it, and some of the directions WordPress is going in in that area. A good read to see the state-of-the-art on fighting The Evil that is spam.
