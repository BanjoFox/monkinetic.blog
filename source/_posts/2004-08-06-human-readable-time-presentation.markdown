Inspired by |Dunstan Orchard|&#39;s entry on <a href="http://www.1976design.com/blog/archive/2004/07/23/redesign-time-presentation">how he&#39;s presenting times in his blog posts</a>, I&#39;ve added a similar feature to monkinetic, helped along by the lovely |WordPress| <a href="http://www.ifelse.co.uk/archives/2004/07/24/time-of-day/">plugin</a> that <a href="http://www.ifelse.co.uk/">phu</a> developed.
