An IT guy at Jodi&#39;s company just told her that Mac networks were &quot;insecurable&quot;. (pause for riotous laughter.) It&#39;s like she IM&#39;d me:

&gt;it&#39;s like, yeah, uh-huh, that&#39;s why we&#39;re in the news all the time b/c our networks have been screwed

This after their company network has been borked several times in the last week by &lt;insert random outlook worm here&gt;.

Oh good, she posted about it: <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/archives/2004/08/06/mac-users-are-all-going-to-hell">Mac Users Are All Going To Hell</a>. Heh.
