Some our our good friends and family have asked how they can help out in our adoption adventure. As a service to them I&#39;ve created a <a href="http://redmonk.net/adoption/how_to_help.php">How To Help</a> page and linked to it from the adorable adoption graphic in the right sidebar of this page. Ok, now everyone go look at the cute graphic...

Yes, it *is* adorable, isn&#39;t it? Anyway, I&#39;ll be adding to that page over time as we find other interesting and useful ways that you, too, can help out. Joy!
