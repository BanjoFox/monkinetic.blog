|Jodi| and I are celebrating 6 years of marriage today! On August 15, 1998, Jodi and I walked down the aisle in <a href="http://www.churchofthemessiah.org/">Episcopal Church of the Messiah</a> and into that primary place in each others lives. We&#39;ve had some hard times, but these 6 years have been wonderful.

Jodi, I love you more today than ever before, and I&#39;m looking forward to those next 60 years together!
