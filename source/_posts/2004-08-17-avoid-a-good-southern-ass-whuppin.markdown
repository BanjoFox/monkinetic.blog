<a href="http://randomurl.com">RandomURL</a>: <a href="http://randomurl.com/archives/2004/08/07/313/">Tips for Travelling in the South</a>. How *not* to get your ass kicked in the south.

> 13) Don't ridicule our Southern manners. We say sir and ma'am. We hold doors open for others. We offer our seats to old folks because such things are expected of civilized people. Behave yourselves around our sweet little gray-haired grandmothers or they'll kick some manners into your ass just like they did ours.
