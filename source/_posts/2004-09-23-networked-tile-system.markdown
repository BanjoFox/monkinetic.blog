[Pervasive Ambience: Networked Tile System - designboom](http://www.designboom.com/contest/view.php?contest_pk=2&amp;item_pk=368&amp;p=2):
&gt;Each tile is embedded with electrical wiring and connectors. When placed together, the tiles form an electrical network that can span throughout entire rooms. This eliminates the mess of cables and cords that would otherwise be present. Designed to work with these networked tiles are &quot;node&quot; tiles, which include: lighting tiles, heated tiles, flat speaker tile.&quot;
