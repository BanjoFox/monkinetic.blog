We&#39;re in late-night mode again at work. With deadlines upon us, we&#39;re scrambling to get stuff done, and wiring bits of applications to other bits as fast as we can. This is the part of software development that sucks, when deadline-driven production takes you off of replacing the tools that desperately need to be replaced.

*Sigh*.
