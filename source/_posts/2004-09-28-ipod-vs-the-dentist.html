I had a dental appointment today, and (despite it&#39;s very low battery) decided to take the &#39;pod along to give me something to listen to behind the whine and grand of the drill. *Shudder*.

Surprisingly, the battery lasted all the way through the hour+ appointment, and I got to listen to some backlogged <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail194.html">Gilmor Gang</a> from <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/">IT Conversations</a>. Cool!

Despite the occasional requests and comments from the dentist, and the inevitable experiments in bone-conduction, I found that I was able to follow the show and it really made the time go by faster.
