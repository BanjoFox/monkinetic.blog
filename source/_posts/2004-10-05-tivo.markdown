Jodi and I want a <a href="http://www.tivo.com/2.0.asp">TiVo</a> for Christmas.

Hey, I just got it: T(i)V(o) == TV. Heh.

So why do we want a TiVo? Well, a few reasons. We don&#39;t have a whole lot of television that we watch, but there are shows that we&#39;d love to be able to timeshift, that come on at odd hours or that have schedule conflicts. Also, once we get LT, we&#39;re going to have to make any television still worth watching work around the schedule of a 1.5-year-old.

We&#39;d also like to be able to TiVo a couple shows for LT, but to be honest, I don&#39;t want him to get addicted so early in life, so the TV will likely stay off during toddler hours.
