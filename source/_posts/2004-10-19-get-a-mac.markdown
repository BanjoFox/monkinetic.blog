I have a Windows PC under my desk right now, dead. It was working fine until recently when it started rebooting itself every few hours, then fianlly would not boot at all. I never used it for more than website testing, but I suspect some sort of malware had gotten involved, even though I never even *launched* Outlook.

So, now the PC&#39;s CRT is hooked to my beloved 17&#39; Powerbook, giving me much more room to play in Mac OS X. :D
