More from Dan Gilmor -- <a href="http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/010984.shtml">A Report From Columbus</a>:

<blockquote>Two apparently Republican poll workers have been showing people at our precinct as their demonstration of voting (ohio has state-hired assistants who can show how to operate the touch screen machines, with live ballots and voters in the booth) only how to vote for Bush.</blockquote>

If this is true, and I have no reason yet to think otherwise, these challengers should be arrested. This is the kind of thing that <em>no one should tolerate</em>, and is the kind of crap that gets us &#39;elections-by-court&#39;. I generally lean Republican, but this kind of... <em>stuff</em>... makes me feel sick.
