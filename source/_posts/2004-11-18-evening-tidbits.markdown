Doing some work this evening... I lost my <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> subscriptions and managed to rebuild most of them from the cache folder, so I spent the time cleaning out the list, unsubscribing from many feeds that I just did not care about anymore. In the same spirit, I&#39;ve been unsubscribing from a ton of mailing lists, and re-subscribing to them from my <a href="http://gmail.google.com/gmail">Gmail</a> account. Let Google store my list archives, with all its searchable gigabyteness.
