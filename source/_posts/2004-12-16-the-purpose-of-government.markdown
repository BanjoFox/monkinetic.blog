Le Sabot Post-Moderne - <a href="http://www.postmodernclog.com/archives/cat_ukraine.html#000836">Yanukovych -- Left, Right or Nowhere?</a>:

&gt;&quot;Politico-economic tribalism captures the clan-based spoils system of Ukraine. When you hear about the oligarchs, you&#39;re probably imagining a few marquee names like Pinchuk or Akhmetov. But the system is more complex than that. For example, Kuchma&#39;s group, the Dnepropetrovsk Clan, contains about 200 businessmen. <em>The purpose of government is to bring home spoils for your tribe, through legislation, subsidies, and sweetheart privatization deals</em>.&quot;

[Emphasis mine]

Hm. Could almost be written about our own government.
