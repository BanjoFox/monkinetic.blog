&gt;We want to build a real web-based calendar: to make it trivially easy to publish a calendar, to invite anyone with an email address to an an appointment and process their RSVPs, to get to your calendar via HTML or RSS or with an instant messenger or with SMS. We think it&#39;s time someone rethought calendars, and we have a lot of new ideas.

This looks pretty cool. I hope it works out. <a href="http://www.thelinuxlink.net/tllts/">The Linux  Link Tech Show</a> (a podcast to which I <a href="http://www.thelinuxlink.net/tllts/tllts.rss">subscribe</a>) interviewed Nat Friedman from Ximian/Novell (Hula is based on Novell&#39;s recently open-sourced product <a href="http://">NetMail</a>) in a recent show - check it out.
