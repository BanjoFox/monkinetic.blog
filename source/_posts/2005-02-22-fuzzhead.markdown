I&#39;ve got a couple of posts in the works but my head has gone all fuzzy. I&#39;m going to go do some house-straightening (I&#39;ve decided that I cannot use the word house-cleaning to describe any house-work I do because <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net">the love of my life</a> seems to always have to follow me, Doing It Right) then I&#39;ll come back and try to compose. One of the posts is the first in a series of &quot;sites I read&quot; posts that includes a micro-interview with Rands of <a href="http://randsinrepose.com">Rands in Repose</a>. Stay tuned.
