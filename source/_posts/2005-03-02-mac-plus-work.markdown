<a href="http://redmonk.net/mt/mt-static/uploads/3macDesktop.jpg"><img alt="3 Mac Desktop" class="at-xid-6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b3647e970c" src="http://steveivy.typepad.com/.a/6a010534988cd3970b0120a5b3647e970c-pi" style="float:right; padding: 0 0 4px 7px;" /></a> I took our Mac Plus into work today and set it up on my desk. It doesn&#39;t do anything useful, but it looks really cool. :-) I still need a SCSI cable before it will boot (off the *10 mb* hard drive), since I don&#39;t have a System floppy.

When |Jodi| and I were first married, I found that the Mac Plus had HyperCard on it, and wrote a fun little guestbook program. The MP sat on a table by the door and we had guest sign in. Ah, the good ol&#39; days. Until this morning it sat on a ledge looking over our living room, along with the Powerbook 5400. 

Also, note the <a href="http://redmonk.net/archives/2000/09/12/lego-plus/">LEGO Mac Plus</a> on the microshelf above the monitor.
