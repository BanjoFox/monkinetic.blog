Geek alert: Does anyone know if there&#39;s a way to ask iTunes for the elapsed time of the currently playing track? I don&#39;t see anything in the AppleScript dictionary, but maybe I&#39;m looking in the wrong place...

Update: Kreg Steppe <a href="http://redmonk.net/archives/2005/03/07/elapsed-time-of-current-track-in-itunes/#comments">found it</a>. Thank Kreg!
