At work we&#39;re trying to set up a bunch of users on laptops with directory-based authentication and home directories. The trouble we&#39;re running into is that these laptops are all wireless, and on OS X, airport doesn&#39;t start until a user logs in. Therefore the machine can&#39;t see the authentication directory on the network until a local user has logged in and out again.

We need some way to get OS X to join a trusted wireless network before a user logs into the system - anyone have experience with this?

Tried so far: Mac OS X Hints and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=os+x+wireless+startup&amp;btnG=Search">Google</a>.
