####FileMaker Pro developer needed

Content Connections is looking for a FileMaker Pro developer for a part-time contract starting immediately and extending for several months. This contract will be for on-call application support and periodic maintenance for a number of FileMaker Pro 6-based web applications. The application codebase consists of nearly 50 databases with CDML-based HTML and PHP templates (format files). 

Experience building web applications with FileMaker Pro 6 is a must. Additionally, experience with PHP in general and the FileSpring Pipeline php script from WellSpring Data [1] is a plus.
