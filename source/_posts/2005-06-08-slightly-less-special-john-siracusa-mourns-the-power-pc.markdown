&gt;That, in a nutshell, is why this is a dark day for Apple. It&#39;s yet another little thing that Macs used to do, if not always better, then at least differently than Windows PCs. Macs are now slightly less special.

Preach it, John.

I&#39;m hopeful, but melancholy at the same time. Goodbye, PowerPC.
