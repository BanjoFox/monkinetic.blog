I&#39;ve updated WordPress on this site to <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">1.5.1.2</a>, and SpamKarma to version <a href="http://unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma/dev/">2b9</a>. I&#39;m re-enabling comments for non-registered users, and opened up trackbacks again.

Do your worst, spammers.
