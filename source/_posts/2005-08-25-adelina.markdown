Well, |Jodi| <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/index.php/archives/2005/08/23/our-god-is-faithful">has the happy news</a>... we&#39;ve found our (Lord-willing) daughter-to-be!!

She&#39;s absolutely beautiful, and has a smile to warm, or break, your heart. She&#39;s also deaf. She has yet to speak a word to us, but we love her just the same. Her name is Adelina - a name as lovely as she is, and we&#39;re keeping it.

*\*blissful sigh\**
