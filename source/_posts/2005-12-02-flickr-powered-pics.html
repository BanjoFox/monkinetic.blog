I&#39;m playing around with <a href="http://www.randombyte.net/blog/projects/falbum/">FAlbum</a>, a <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> plugin that pulls recent posts from my <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> account. It&#39;s nicely done, though the documentation is somewhat lacking. I&#39;ve added several recent pics to the top of the blog.
