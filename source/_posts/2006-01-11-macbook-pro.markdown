Yes, I want a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro">MacBook Pro</a>.
Yes, the name sucks. &quot;PowerBook&quot; was such a strong brand - and it came about long before the CPU had &quot;power&quot; in it, so why drop it now?

Update; <a href="http://www.unsanity.org/archives/000445.php">Unsanity agrees.</a>
