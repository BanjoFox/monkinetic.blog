|Jodi| and I took the munchkin on her first real hiking trip today, to the Superstition mountains, on Peralta Trail (which I also wrote about <a href="http://redmonk.net/index.php?s=peralta">here</a>). Adelina did <em>great</em>. She loved the mountains, and kept wanting to go to the top of various peaks we saw. Then she found a stick - nay, a Stick - and had fun stopping and writing letters in the sand, or drawing smiley faces. What a girl! She was beat by the end of the hike, but much fun was had by all. <a href="http://speakshermind.redmonk.net/gallery/view/hike-mlkday-2006/">Pics now in the gallery</a>.
