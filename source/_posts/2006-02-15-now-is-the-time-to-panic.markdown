I tried to access this site while at [the coffee shop](http://www.stonegroundscafe.builderspot.com/page/page/1339477.htm) today, and the wireless was not connecting. Assuming that it was working, I got the &quot;could not connect to redmonk.net&quot; message from Firefox, and freaked out, thinking my site was down. I tried to hit the web panel at my host, and in an amusing freudian slip, I typed

    panic.dreamhost.com

into my browser window.
