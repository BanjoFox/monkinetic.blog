Somehow I can&#39;t get that excited that about the [iPod HiFi](http://www.apple.com/ipodhifi/), when my daughter has the equivalent of [an iPod &gt; brain interface](http://www.bionicear.com/support/betterliving/ald_music_players.asp):

&gt;###Auria Direct Connect
&gt;Your simple audio input connector for easy access to auxiliary microphones, FM systems, MP3 player, CD players, telecoils, and other assistive listening technology and consumer electronics.
