[Iterating features and getting them right](http://feeds.feedburner.com/veen?m=246):

&gt;The reason I mention this is because we&#39;re currently revisiting our browser stats in the application, and it&#39;s a really good example of the process. We started with one simple screen: what percentage of your users visited with IE, Firefox, Safari, or &quot;Other&quot; -- along with a way to change the date range being viewed.

I flagged this mostly as a pretty UI snapshot.
