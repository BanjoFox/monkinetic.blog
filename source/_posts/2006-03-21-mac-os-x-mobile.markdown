[Mac OS X Mobile](http://mattgemmell.com/2006/01/22/mac-os-x-mobile#comments):

>First, a necessary disclaimer: there is no Mac OS X Mobile. It's a fictional version of OS X designed for PDA devices, which I've just made up and which I'm going to discuss in this blog post, since I've been thinking about PDAs a lot lately. Once again: this is all theoretical and just for the purposes of discussion.

Oh, but what a fun discussion.
