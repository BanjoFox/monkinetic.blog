I&#39;ve been having some fun with Flash lately - witness the new header on this site. :-) It&#39;s not perfect, I haven&#39;t figured out the font embedding correctly, so the quotes seem to appear in some default (Times?) font on any machine but my own. Grr. Still working on it.

Oh, the header combines a couple of my favorite things: [Monty Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python), meet [R.E.M.](http://remhq.com)!
