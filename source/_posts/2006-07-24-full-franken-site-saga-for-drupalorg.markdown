After some prodding, I posted the full, and slightly edited, [&quot;Building The Franken-site&quot; saga](http://redmonk.net/more/tech/franken-site-i) on Drupal.org. It basically covers using XML-RPC as the glue to get Drupal content into a Wordpress template and vice-versa. The next version of this site (under construction now) will work this way.

[Using XML-RPC to combine Drupal and Wordpress on a site](http://drupal.org/node/74350).
