Today is my second day at the [new gig](http://www.godaddy.com) and I&#39;m getting used to a Windows environment. First installs included [Firefox](http://mozilla.com/firefox) of course, and [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org).

I&#39;m a die-hard [Quicksilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/) fan on OS X, so the idea of pointing and clicking to launch things is [anathema](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/anathema) to me. Today I found [Launchy](http://launchy.net/), and open source launcher for Windows that, while not as full featured as Quicksilver, does the launching thing in the same way and has me back in keyboard mode. w00.
