While looking for advice in trying to develop a solid grid for designing a css-based layout for a site, I ran across [this awesome visual grid](http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2006/07/layout_grid_bookmarklet/) by [Andy Budd](http://www.andybudd.com/) that can be set as a background on your design to show you pixel measurements on the page. He&#39;s also got a bookmarket so you can apply the grid to any design you&#39;re working on with a single click. W00!
