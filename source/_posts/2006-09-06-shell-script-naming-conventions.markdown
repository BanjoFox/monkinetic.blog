I&#39;m working on a set of shell scripts at work to aid in deploying projects to our dev server and a test environment, as well as update a network database with information about the releases... and I&#39;m having naming issues.

Assuming you&#39;re the shell-scripting type - how do you name your shell scripts, assuming they should be somewhat descriptive names, but can be easily called from a command line?
