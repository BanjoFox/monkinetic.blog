[What you get](http://www.macsupport.ca/2006/10/31/unpacking-a-refurbished-apple-macbook/) when you unpack an Apple refurbished product.

[TUAW says](http://feeds.tuaw.com/~r/weblogsinc/tuaw/~3/43885331/):

&gt;Plus, you won&#39;t be tempted to save the box it comes in and take up room in your house, and that has to count for something.

(I just recently managed to throw away the 17&quot; Powerbook box I got two+ years ago...)
