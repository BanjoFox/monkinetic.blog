Living life in a cubicle? At work, I just moved from the cozy confines of the designer&#39;s room (khaki walls, IKEA-provided indirect lighting, ironic bank of high-school lockers) to a spot in the developer&#39;s cube-farm. So I&#39;ve started looking for links to resources for improving my surroundings.

To such ends, I&#39;ve started a [Cubicle Rescue](http://ma.gnolia.com/groups/cubicle-rescue) group on [Ma.gnolia](http://ma.gnolia.com/). Feel free to join up and contribute!
