###New App &amp; Open Source Software

In my limited spare time, I&#39;ve recently been hacking on a new web application in Rails. It&#39;s a lifestream app, based on the ideas largely introduced by [Jeremy Keith](http://adactio.com/journal/1202/). This app is a basic web app that allows for online source feed management and soon, multiple users.

Through the short development process, I&#39;ve had loads of help from a small group of rails developers on IRC. They&#39;ve been extremely helpful, patient, and willing to dish out a boot-to-the-head from time to time when necessary.

Last week, I had a conversation with one of guys on whose advice and helpful tips I&#39;ve depended on while finding my way around Ruby and Rails. In this conversation he communicated that he was assuming this was an open source project, and wondered if I had a public source control setup somewhere. Now, I do have a public SVN repo setup, for my own use and for the convenience of showing bits of code to folks, but I had not thought about whether this application would be open source or not, so I wasn&#39;t sure how to respond.
