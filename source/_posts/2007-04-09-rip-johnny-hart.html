Via Scott Kurtz, creator of the [PVP](http://www.pvponline.com/blog/) comic, the news that [Johnny Hart, creator of the B.C. comic](http://www.pvponline.com/blog/3252/rip-johnny-hart) passed away. He was 76 and *was at his desk drawing*.

Like, Scott, I grew up on B.C. and it was always one of favorite comics. Rest In Peace, Johnny -- I know you will.
