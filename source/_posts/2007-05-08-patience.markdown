[Now that's how it's supposed too work](http://blog.labnotes.org/2007/05/07/patience-buildr-docs-coming-up/).

I [posted](http://redmonk.net/archives/2007/05/07/i-hate-rdoc/) oh... (looks) 1 hour ago about my frustration with [Buildr]() at giving us RDocs instead of documentation, and Assaf responds in [Patience, Buildr docs coming up](http://blog.labnotes.org/2007/05/07/patience-buildr-docs-coming-up/):

&gt;I agree. RDocs are not acceptable documentations.

&gt;RDocs are reference material, information you need after you know what you're looking for, and just need to quickly find it.

&gt;Except an official Buildr announcement later this week that will include usable documentation. One you can actually learn from. Hopefully, one you'll enjoy reading from.

I'm looking forward to it, Assaf, and thanks for the response!
