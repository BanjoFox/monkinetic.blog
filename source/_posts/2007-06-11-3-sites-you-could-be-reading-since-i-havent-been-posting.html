About 3 months ago I was transferred to a new group at work, to help them finish up a release, then to start in on some new features. Well, we are about one week from release, and we&#39;re in crunch mode. Because of the increased focus, and stress, posting here has almost dried up! Sorry about that.

I&#39;ve got a few posts rolling around in my head, as well as 4 or 5 drafts waiting for attention, so once we release I hope to get some time to pay some mind to the old blog. In the meantime, here are 3 sites you could be reading:

1. [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net)
2. [The Macalope](http://macalope.com/)
3. for the productivity-minded among you, [Merlin Mann](http://43folders.com).
