Quick observation: it&#39;s funny how our early years in a community shape our views. For example: In my brain, [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com) is the default &quot;Dave&quot; on the internet. [Wes Felter](http://wmf.editthispage.com) is the only &quot;Wes&quot; on the internet, and [Jim Roepcke](http://jim.roepcke.com) is the default &quot;Jim&quot;. Any time I see any of these names in isolation online, these are the guys my brain puts up on the viewscreen.

Is that weird?
