My lifestream site, , is now powered  by [tumblr](http://tumblr.com), instead of my home-brewed Rails app. I never got the Rails app updating like I wanted, and then over the weekend it stopped responding at all. Since I started playing with lifestreams, so many good apps ([tumblr](http://tumblr.com), [Jaiku](http://jaiku.com)) have come out that fighting with my own is not currently worth my time.
