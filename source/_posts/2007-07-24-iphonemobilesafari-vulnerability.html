[Apple](http://apple.com) is going to need to up their security staff, esp. with a&quot;real OS&quot; on the iPhone. Exhibit A: an [iPhone browser vulnerability](http://www.securityevaluators.com/iphone/):

&gt;Dr. Miller, a former employee of the National Security Agency who has a doctorate in computer science, demonstrated the hack to a reporter by using his iPhone&#39;s Web browser to visit a Web site of his own design.
