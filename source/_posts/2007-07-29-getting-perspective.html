There's a [good discussion](http://creativebits.org/it_isnt_1984_anymore) (in the comments) on [CreativeBits](http://creativebits.org) about recovering from getting your first logo idea rejected, with some good thoughts on determining the actual target of an identity.

>I came up with something fun and modern, which is what they always promote to their clients. My CEO sent the logo (as well as other comps) out to "test it" with 50 of their past clients and it got shot down.
