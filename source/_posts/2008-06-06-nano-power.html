Ok, these may be really really stupid or really really practical ideas -- so no comments starting with "Steve you're an idiot!" -- but I was thinking today about ways to generate power around the house.

What if electric power could be practically generated and distributed by micro or nano devices embedded in motion-generating fixtures around a house? Opening doors, drawers, running water from faucets - there's a lot of energy that perhaps could be captured. I doubt it would be a lot of power, but enough, perhaps to charge small devices?

Crazy? Interesting? What do you think?
