A reminder for social software nerds in the Bay area: [Six Apart](http://sixapart.com) is hosting a [Portable Contacts hackathon](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1078491/) today, and tomorrow is the [Portable Contacts Summit](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1005694/) at the MySpace offices. I want to talk more about Portable Contacts and what this means, but that's for another post.
