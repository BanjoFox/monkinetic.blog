[Gordon Ramsay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Ramsay) may be a jerk on his TV show "Hell's Kitchen", but he can cook a killer [scrambled egg breakfast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU_B3QNu_Ks). I made these yesterday, had them on sourdough toast, and while they were too rich in the morning for my kids and wife, I'd happily stuff my arteries with these awesome eggs any day.
