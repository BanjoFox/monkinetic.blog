I've built a new site I'm experimenting with: [kinetic energy](http://k.monkinetic.com). KE is based on Six Apart's new Motion codebase (python + django + typepad apis) and is generously hosted by [strangecode](http://strangecode.com). I don't get many non-spam comments here, b/c I'm a lazy blogger. :-) But this is a neat app and I wanted to play around with it. So check it out, post something you find interesting, and if I think so too maybe I'll repost it on the front of the site here!
