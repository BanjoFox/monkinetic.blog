[TypePad Micro](http://everything.typepad.com/blog/2009/11/typepad-micro-blogging-announcement.html) launched today from (my employer - wooo!) Six Apart. Amidst the [tweets](https://search.twitter.com/search?q=typepad+micro) you might miss that existing TypePad blogs - like this one - also get the new features. So while the hype is on microblogging in TypePad, I'm happy that we're also lowering the friction points for posting quick updates, photos and videos to our existing blogs. #goteam!
