I&#39;m collecting samples of sci-fi noir and cyberpunk film concept art on <a href="http://monkinetic.enjoysthin.gs/">http://monkinetic.enjoysthin.gs/</a> as source material for a LEGO build in that theme. Bits collected so far include a bunch of Bladerunner artwork, some bits from Fifth Element, and a few from Ghost in the Shell.
