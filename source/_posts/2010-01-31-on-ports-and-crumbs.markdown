> As expected, there are practically no buttons and openings on the iPad.  -- [Andy Inahtko](http://www.suntimes.com/technology/ihnatko/2017907,ihnatko-ipad-hands-on-012810.article)

Of course Steve Jobs never met a port he didn't want to remove, but ports on the iPad strike me as the kind of thing that dust, dirt, and toddler crumbs would quickly clog, when you consider the ways in which the iPad will be used. Perhaps not such a crazy idea, leaving them out?
