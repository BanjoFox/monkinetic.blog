>Yahoo "Connect" is first smart strategic move by Yahoo in years. http://read.bi/dn79EC

I agree with [Chris Dixon](http://twitter.com/cdixon/status/27760022496) re: [this Business Insider article](http://www.businessinsider.com/yahoo-plans-to-copy-facebook-connect-2010-10) - Yahoo's market it quite diverse and made of regular people; I think that not being known as a "social network" may make some users more comfortable using them as an signin provider.

I wonder if the Facebook Connect UI ever *adds* friction to the signin instead of removing it? "Do I want my friends to all know about this?"
