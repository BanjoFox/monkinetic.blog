### On The Significance of HyperCard

Discovering HyperCard in a closet during a desktop publishing course changed my entire worldview.

## This was my first about page:

>My name is Steve Ivy, and I run redmonk.net. I'm a web architect by trade, for Compass. My unofficial title is web architect, designer, and xml evangelist.

>Work Stuff:

>I discovered the web back in 1994, when Mosaic was really cool. The office I worked in as a graphic design production assistant was next door to the local ISP. I convinced the owner to get an account. To grind out a clich&#xE9;: The rest was history. [I should clarify: I was not at all involved in the development of Ethicom's site. Pity- it's a nice site. ;-)]

>In 1996 I found myself in Germany working for a great design studio, ArtLab Europe. I knew that the web thing was going to be big (honest!) and again convinced my boss (Thanks Joseph!) to let me do some investigating. Soon I was neck deep in FreeBSD, BBEdit, Perl, and the Bare Bones Guide To HTML. We quickly found ourselves with a rock solid FreeBSD-based web server internally, and we transformed ArtLab into a graphic design and webdesign studio.

>I also discovered Frontier in 1996. I've been spoiled for web development ever since. If you are a web developer, and don't know what Frontier is, check it out here.

>In 1998 I stumbled onto XML; totally by accident, even before there was an XML.com. ArtLab was working with a client who was transforming XML-stored content into PageMaker-compatible markup and delivering it, simultaneously rendering a website. The penny dropped, and it's been a crusade of mine ever since, much to the annoyance of several groups of coworkers to date. Well, no one's perfect.

>Other Stuff:

>I am a rabid, ok, maybe not rabid, but really really (really) fan of R.E.M. I narrowly missed seeing them in Hamburg, Germany when Bill Berry had something pop in his noggin, and darn it, they decided to skip some shows. Imagine that.

>Should we talk about the weather?

>Lego Plus

>So what do you do on an evening that you're bored and don't know what to do? Why, build a Mac Plus out of LEGO, of course!

>Why redmonk.ret?

>As a sometime freelance web developer, I've needed an online home for a while. More than that, I want a venue for communication which is entirely mine. redmonk.net is that place. 

## Actually, this was my first about page:

Ok, apparently I was wrong, and [this ArtLab page](http://redmonk.net/files/oldsites/steve-artlab-1996/about.html) was my first about page. Wow, who's the creepy bald guy?
